The goal was to find out more about their creative work process / model and self-identity to be able to understand the potential of creative agencies in today's society.</p><div id=\"23_c_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Intro</h3> \r\n<p>23 Critters was founded in 2010 and is based in Stockholm, Sweden. 23 Critters or 23C for short started out as a web development company and has gradually expanded their work to web services, business development and custom screen solutions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p> 23C has a website with a minimum amount of information that somewhat contrasts their good network of developers, influx of jobs, steady backers and prestigious clients. They have a Facebook page and a similar Twitter account where they post every now and then, but most of their work is not made public. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>23C consists of six autodidactic developers and hackers with a general problem-solving nature; four persons are partners in the company and two persons are employees. They are all men. Going back to the 90s they have been friends before they took part in forming 23C. They all have a deep interest in their work, share a passion for technology and to an extent also have overlapping ethics, skills and interests. I have a shared history with some of them in the work around Piratbyr&aring;n dating back to 2004.   There is one frontend developer, three backend developers and one designer. The frontend languages are typically Html5, Css3 and JavaScript, with the extension of jquery, mootools and Sass. One person is dedicated to Flash. The designer&rsquo;s main tool is Illustrator.   23C state that they favor open source technologies such as the Python framework Django but they also have some good experience in Java and PHP. They say on their website that they are not picky regarding what programming languages to use but the office discussions reveal that they dislike PHP. The argument is that PHP is both a badly written language with a lot of security issues but more importantly it is a slippery slope for web development. Here they voice a general concern over the state of development.</p><div id=\"23_c_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The concern is mainly about the low quality of product that PHP produces and the low developer pride it leads to &ldquo;- if you end up installing Wordpress blogs half the day&rdquo;. It might be an easy solution but it doesn't produce skilled developers and also impoverishes the industry as pricing for such skills is lower. On top of that it makes the web poor and boring and in the end gives the business a bad reputation. The developers at 23C have a kind of developers pride in what they do and know they can do better. As they state on their homepage &ldquo;23C is a team of designers, engineers and others who are concerned about making the virtual world look, feel and function better&rdquo;.   During the period that I stayed with them 23C had two major projects and several smaller. I spent most of my time with a senior developer working on one of their major projects: an online retail store for the Asian market. He was exclusively showing me his work and transferring his knowledge to me by close interaction and collaboration. As in a master workshop, knowledge and craftsmanship in programming, concrete tools and programming theory was handed down directly to the apprentice. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work process of 23C can be very informal because of the small sized team. It is initiated with general analysis and discussions and then continued with an Illustrator design draft. The draft is handed to the frontend developers that make the first mock-up of the design. Meanwhile work on backend system design starts. After this, depending on the size of the job, missing pieces and changes are gradually worked into the project. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The integration of the various parts is done in an ad-hoc fashion and is possible because they form such a small team. The iterative design process is a critical component in how they are able to integrate their different skills in production.   The office that they share with a design and architecture company is located on of the main streets in downtown Stockholm. It&rsquo;s an open office landscape with a library, kitchen and discreet conference rooms.    The team has their workspace at the back of the office around large tables that form a rectangular shape. Small personalized areas are formed around big monitors where everybody can plug in their laptops, place their personal gadgets, headphones, cell phones, magazines and tech-related books. During the day coffee cups cram the tables. At night and when people are in crunch time, take away is eaten in front of the monitors.   With such small work teams as three persons 23C have an informal work methodology that uses direct communication. This is facilitated by the open office space where they can address each other directly on the development of projects and also help each other on any issues that might occur, all with a minimum of effort.   Discussions are mainly held on project iteration but also on design principles and developer culture as well as more general topics, from gaming and gadgets to biotechnology and science fiction or just the latest chatter from Reddit. The discussions play a vital part in the general information dissemination, in project development and in the production of the identity of the group. The discussions are creating consensus of projects and strengthen their identity, produce self-awareness and confidence. This is an important process for them to be able to push the envelope and be in the forefront of what they do in their competitive environment. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my time at 23C discussions on the projects were often lively between the designer and the developers. What was to be the next logical step in the current project was sometimes sold with a lot of effort. For instance the designer argued for more time before he was ready to move into the next phase of development. Disagreements were iterated over many times and body language and sometimes strategic frustration and silence was used. Watching the meetings through the glass windows of the conference room I could almost touch the compressed moment of the creation of 23C. I really enjoyed the critical discussions and how they voiced opinions to really pinpoint an argument for quality, how to best reach beyond the customary and what was the real value of a product.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p> While the informal process seems to work well, the midday working hours could be a bit fragmented in terms of the hours of concentrated coding. Accordingly, a lot of work is done from home or in the evening at the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work-hours are full flex so they can work where it is best suited, from home or the office. Since no mandatory presences are required sometimes the office is empty. As a logical and vital extension of the office space and full flex the principle is that everyone should be reachable on IRC chat. Here issues can be discussed and solved and questions posted for fast answers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lunch hours are used for meetings and discussions often at restaurants nearby. The topics here are often extended ethical or philosophical discussions on the state of development, work principles and process and ideological or ethical anecdotic reflections on digital, political and social systems. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Commentary</h3> \r\n<p>Primarily originating from the informal discussions at the office and during lunch, a logical thread of thought crystallizes. It is well summarized in the quote from the website: the systems surrounding us can be made better ( &ldquo;the virtual world look, feel and function better&rdquo;.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I assume that the discussions can be seen as a way of establishing the identity of the team in the competitive environment of the company as well as in a larger ethical and social context of openness. In the discussions there is clearly a positioning against what they pinpoint as negative player protocols, services, design and behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I interpret this case in a wider context these bad entities often seem to benefit from hierarchical, closed and centralized systems. This is contrasted with open technologies such as the internet that has the potential to break and remake these systems. An adaption to more open and non-traditional forms of development and protocols is something that demands highly skilled agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To further understand the position of 23C we can look at two competing models of production: centralized and decentralized. Internet with is p2p topologies has made the difference between these two systems evident as it forms a digital convergence where almost everything is gradually being digitalized and potentially connected. This has opened up for a big change in the way we produce, distribute and consume in society today. The changes present both opportunities and threats for businesses and forces them to form strategies to adapt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the first to develop a model for how open software development works was Eric Raymond in his book The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1997). &ldquo;Internet-enabled collaboration and free information sharing, not monopolistic control, is the key to innovation and product quality&rdquo;. He describes the hierarchical cathedral-like systems of the past in contrast with distributed bazaar-like system with more freedom. I think it is right to see 23C in this light.   The informal work process set in the open office landscape is a flexible and effective model that draws from the common experiences as software developers. When the developers state that they can do better, it is about creating better services for their clients, but in a broader perspective it is also about pursuing a more general investigation and exploration of these possibilities to benefit society as a whole.   In aiming for the better there is a time-aspect. Short term goals that relate to the business and more speculative goals that relate to the potential of systems and what systems could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The discussions range from utopian dreams for a better future to concrete everyday solutions and trade-offs in the existing protocols, tools and the company. It is possible to have a different type of organization in systems of work, in politics and society, but when it comes to the everyday interaction and maintenance of systems, interfaces, games, tools and programing languages it is different. Sure these systems can be extended, subverted and hacked but they must also be maintained and work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will now give some examples of how this plays out in the discussions on openness and enclosure, central and decentralised, hierarchical and distributed system and between the actual and utopia. The first several examples are of the working conditions and the competitive environment and then there are a few examples of reflections on interfaces, protocols, tools and games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contradiction between the ethics of 23C and the fact that 23C is a business can arise. Trade-offs are made between ethics and possible income, jobs and clients. Sometimes they refuse to work with clients they dislike, for instance they declined to make a website for a company that was in conflict with a syndicalist union. Sometimes the stakes are too high for them to refuse projects. They might engage with a client even though they have a business model of enclosure, like when they engage with subcontractors of Hollywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This shows the contradiction between the activist morale that aims for openness and a better world and the everyday trade-off of running a business. One of them formulates the relation between activism and business and with a kind of rationalizing logic - I want to take from the rich and do something good with the money, also adding activists always have too little money. To see a company as a way of activism is a trade-off between power and freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CEO said that the advertising agencies in collaboration with big media are making Internet ugly and bad because they are trying to uphold old regimes of control. He thinks other forms of less hierarchical dialogue might form over time with the help of the open principles of Internet. Meanwhile we do things we enjoy and are awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He brings up the difference between working cultures in different countries. The hierarchical system like in Japan and low wages in England make the condition for web development poor in comparison with Nordic countries and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes having better solution, knowing better and being skilled can be used to &ldquo;own&rdquo; others, especially when customers overstep their boundaries. On one occasion he used the fact that people from &ldquo;Media&rdquo; don't understand the core principle of the difference between domain name and hosting to an advantage. The client has not been paying the bills and is trying hard not to. &quot;- Take down the site,&quot; he says. -&rdquo;They do not understand how the internet architecture works and that makes them weak&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A friend of 23C that worked as a system administrator at another company came to the office several times to complain and discuss the working condition on the company where he was employed. He was concerned about the impossibility of the top down model of information flow in the work process where people on the actual jobs would have been able to make things better if they were only let to do so by their superior. He describes a conflict between the technician and managerial part of the company upholding different models and upholding hierarchical and horizontal decision flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that the operational managers at are experts at being managers but have no clue how to solve real problems, still they are occupied with prestige. - As a technician, you are a problem solver, they are meeting coordinators. It easily becomes &ldquo;us against them&rdquo;. In the end he got so tired of the unresolved problems and when an opportunity opened he just resigned from his job and started to work for 23C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>23C is a company that works a lot with software interfaces. Usability and effectiveness is essential both when it comes to products they make and tools they use. Concern over poor interfaces and services and discussions about interfaces as creative systems was on the table in various forms. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the design process, how to make their designs intuitive but not generic. How their working tools such as different programing languages and desktop programs for design facilitate the creative process. What constitutes a good programming language, comparing the experience from different game development platforms and what possibilities and potential they hold.   Trying to strike a balance between skills and knowledge thresholds. Interfaces that are capable and where one&rsquo;s skills can leverage the it in full. Contrast the simple and brilliant interface of IRC for communication with the frustrating interface of Facebook while seeing its success. Compare the simplest and yet powerful command line with a messy desktop application that does the same job. Skills in programing and command line control can overcome design interfaces as a graphical layer and barrier to the more direct command and control of the computer and the world. Where is the common ground between skills, powerful and complex systems and simple interfaces? To answer this it is essential to seek creative possibilities in today&rsquo;s technology dependent world.    What possible interactions are there between the actual and its interfaces? What performativity does the interface hold? Is it closed or open, configurable or hackable? In development where special languages or tools are used, there is a web of feedback in the form of debug reports, documentation and support models. There is also an extended community of other developers on forums and online tutorials. Open source is favored because of the unique environment of knowledges and feedback it produces. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is code in a social context, but coding in itself also holds a speculative force, as a transformative process, new algorithms, typed instruction can open up a path to the imaginary, new and unknown. Here coding leads to speculation on algorithmically and fractal potential, to machine intelligence and emotions, singularity, mind body expansion, dna, drugs, into a maze of emotion, ethics, memory, time, code and text. Coding, protocols and tools are an imaginary space of what is possible to think and do, a genuine art form with full fledged potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One criticism of Spotify as a centralizing service was particularly interesting in this context. The problem with centralized services like Spotify is that they produce consumers. Spotify makes people forget or not learn how to pirate. Piracy here can be seen as a process of finding new possibilities. Spotify imposes a central, monopolists consumption logic and where the knowledge to share music in other ways is fading away. So the critique of Spotify is that it produces consumers instead of active community members, actively taking part in the investigative processes for new possibilities and new search skills. The basic knowledge of finding information beyond playlists and knowledge of how to get access to closed forums or how to configure proxy settings. An alternative must break the logic of centralized services and still remain a tool for communication between connected people (peered clients). This will require skilled people that can make a decentralized concept work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one example of a contradiction in the consumer/central and client skills/decentralization logic. The question that still remains is how it will be possible to attract a larger group of people to take part in these endeavors. How to lower the threshold and still remain decentralized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name 23Critters refers to hacking and gaming. Games play an essential part of the common interest in the group. Many stories and anecdotes were told about games. Games are systems that you can learn from and hack. Some of them jointly played World of Warcraft and were part of the same guild. The CEO told a story about how he spent a year in WoW and how he became a guild leader. He testified that he learned organizational skills for instance when he was directing guild members to do mining and leatherwork to be able to do produce things needed to engage in raids successfully. How classes and races in WoW could be compared and seen as a template for human relationships. Coded worlds leading trails to imagination.   Looking at 23C I was struck by how lively, dense and open the dialogue and reproduction of their identity was. It has been rewarding in relation to the core topics of my research: how creative identities are forming in network society and to find clues to distributed knowledge models. The case has verified the everyday struggles, joys and conflicts these networked processes involve. That skills play such key part in upholding a distributed system and in bridging interfaced possibilities is something I will continue to research in conjunction to discussion on creativity and art (ars and techne) and to social models (gesellschaft and gemeinschaft).   \r\n\r\n<h2>Issues</h2>\r\n\r\n<p> To see a company as a way of activism is a trade-off between power and liberty. If a company can be a model of activism could there also be a way to ensure certain ethical norms relating to for instance open protocols and the commons? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What will happen when 23C grows, how can they maintain their creativity, edge and informal work method and not fall into the trap of hierarchical management?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A weakness in such a small and edgy team of developers as in the case of 23C is that the specialization level is high and redundancy is low. This can leave the company vulnerable in case of sickness or other unforeseen situations. A special case of this surfaced but will not be discussed here. How can one level between edge and redundancy of skills in a small team?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can we level skill, simple interfaces, low thresholds with complex techno-social systems?   23C is a male homosocial entity, can that lead to problems in terms of the experience they hold within the group?   The informal work process set in the open office landscape is a flexible and effective model drawing from the experience of being a software developer. Drawing from software methods like lean and scrum, how can such methods inform the distributed networked knowledge model in the continued research?\r\n\r\n<p> Special Thanks to 23C, and Youkali and Cat for reading. </p>", "html_text": "<p>hej</p>", "realtime_ended": "2012-04-12T10:00:00Z", "publish_at": "2013-10-08T19:16:28Z", "credits": null, "active": true, "slug": "Case_1_23C"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"datetime_modified": "2013-10-24T18:32:28.961Z", "title": "Hacknight Stockholm,  make all", "process": "Reported", "type": "Workshops", "image": "media/4721375213_21b29845ab.jpg", "author": 1, "excerpt": "Hacknight Stockholm 2012, make all - a report Organization: Sparvn&auml;stet in collaboration with the National Museum of Science Dates: August 15 - 17 2012 Location: National Museum of Science Website: http://make-all.se/ Limitations: The project is limited to one night and two days and to the theme of open technologies, net politics and social change", "realtime_started": "2012-08-17T06:00:00Z", "datetime_created": "2013-10-09T14:09:28.183Z", "blog": 1, "the_text": "<h2> Hacknight Stockholm 2012, make all - a report </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Intro We at the hackerspace Sparvn&auml;stet decided to organize a hacknight, the first of its kind in Stockholm. A hacknight is an open, self-organized, independent and free creative technology event, conference and around the clock workshop all in one. The hacknight that we decided to name &ldquo;make all&rdquo; took its blueprint from hacknights organized annually by the hackerspace Forskningsavdelningen in Malm&ouml;.</p> <div id=\"hacknight_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar community events, such as conferences and conventions link groups and individuals from different backgrounds including arts, politics and technology to the extended hacker community and discourse. One example is the Chaos Communication Congress held each year in Germany. The Congress offers talks, workshops and community activities on a wide range of hacker topics and could be described as having an exploratory (critical-creative) attitude towards technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Events like these play an important part in the culture of hackers and developers, as they offer an opportunity to meet like-minded people and exchange experiences, perspectives and knowledge. They lay the foundation for the continuation and expansion of the hacking community and enable the flow of the latest ideas, hacks and skills. In the wider context the events contribute to the discussion and understanding of the impact of technological development in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over two days and one nights in August 2012 we realized our around the clock hacknight &ldquo;make all&rdquo; at the National Museum of Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broader aim of the project was to create a public event of learning and experimenting with open technologies. We also aimed to spark discussions around crucial issues of network society and net politics like privacy, identity and security. Another specific aim was to create a space where the existing extended network of Swedish hackerspaces could come together and manifest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Net politics The first step was to apply for funding from the Swedish Internet Infrastructure Foundation. Even though the application was rejected in the end, it stated our initial intention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Large amounts of personal data are being transmitted, copied and stored in the global network without the everyday user being able to understand the consequences and process of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- We believe that this constitutes a knowledge gap and that it can be seen as preventing a democratic development in society. If people are to be able to understand how technology affects their lives they must have the chance to find out how the underlying systems work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- We believe that it is democratically crucial to create conversations and develop understanding, visions and practice regarding the policies and laws of the net. A good and physically graspable way to inform and learn is to experiment together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to explore net politics, where power imbalance between different actors and interests on the Internet are considered with the networked user in mind. The power differences between more resourceful players, such as governments or large corporations create trust issues and a divide in network society when compared with ordinary citizens as technology users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A way to level these differences is to increase awareness and the general network literacy by information campaigns, self-organized learning and active exploration of networked systems. Thus &ldquo;make all&rdquo; was to be such an event to aid the leveling the playing field of the net. This is something that also can be seen as a continued goal of the work of Sparvn&auml;stet and the hacker community at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the application we pointed out how connected technologies come with rules and laws imposed on the network users. These regulations are the company policies of for example Facebook and Google services, as well as laws and agreements like Sopa, Pipa and Acta that potentially enable a new level of monitoring capabilities and truncation of freedom of expression. These regulations affect both the user&rsquo;s digital and physical identity and the data associated with them, while our digital lives are handed to the cloud. Without knowledge, better alternatives and power we are often bystanders in processes where our personal data is the core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following statement summarizes the discussion as we try to explain the purpose of &ldquo;make all&rdquo; to a local newspaper:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Now that technologies are increasingly part of our lives it is more important than ever with free and open systems. It is about power. If you are dependent on the technology that you do not understand you put control over your life in the hands of others. Therefore it is necessary to consider how these systems really work in practice to be able to relate critically and in the end build better solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, the primary objective of the event has a net political agenda. But this is something that the player that we collaborated with does not regard as equally important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Museum of Science and Nils Olander After the application was rejected our group was still determined to carry out the project. The biggest hurdle was to find a suitable and sufficient location in Stockholm. We knew the curator Nils Olander at National Museum of Science from before, and after good initial email conversations about the possibility for the museum to host such an event we decided to meet. The meeting was held at the museum in March, where we decided to go through with the hacknight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We crystallized the event further at consecutive meetings held at the museum. The basic deal was that we provide our network and organize the event and the museum provide the venue with tables and chairs, toilets and outdoor space for food and extended workshop environments, technical staff, presentation possibilities and internet access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For us it was crucial to keep the event open and free of charge. Even if that went against the normal way the museum would handle such an event, this could be resolved by letting people into the event through a passageway not leading in to the main museum exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nils Olander did all the heavy lifting at the museum. He was a key person as he was very committed to making the event happen, he resolved the internal politics and was active in helping out with bits and pieces of the actual event. He communicated back and forth with the museum offices on our behalf. The offices seem to be excited about the project but at the same time a little worried about their image and how it would look to have hackers organize an event at their premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal politics of the museum can be seen in light of their willingness to realize the event and handle the risk of being associated with the bad name given to hacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interesting aspect was the difference in their press release and the information we gave on the website of the event. The press release of the museum emphasized experimenting and was formulated to make the event look cuter:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- An event for all curious people who are fascinated by disassembling, assembling, and figuring out how things work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we on the &ldquo;make all&rdquo; homepage indicate a strong relation between technical exploration and politics:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because the technology you don't understand owns you. The technology that is unexplored owns us. &ldquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind the scenes in the corridors of the museum the word hack was discussed and it was questioned whether it would fit their image or not. But ultimately, the museum was able to let it pass into the press release, probably by emphasizing experimentation. One particular word was dropped from the press release, lock picking. While it did not make it into the press release, the lock picking station was totally open at the event itself and also one of the most popular ones. Something that points to the process of institutional policy and also a difference between what an institution is willing to say and what they are willing to let happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should also be noted that we did not question this peculiarity. We felt pragmatic and the time was getting short for the press release to be sent. The internal discussion of the museum that was a bit fragmented by an institutional summer disconnection had slowed down the process. The approaching event made a resolution necessary and therefore disparities were solved with a smile. Differences in opinion could be resolved for the time being but would still remain problematic. The tension could be explained by the museums anxiety of being associated with hacking as an unpredictable force. This is kind of key because it obscures the real participatory potential of the net that seems to call all of us as potential hackers (net artists) and essentially what Sparvn&auml;stet is aiming at. I will return to these issues of institutional anxiety and participatory potential later because this difference appears to be a major theme of my research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimating work and extended network. We considered the project to be very feasible both because we were determined to make it happen, but also because our extended network seemed to be interested in participating both as guests, volunteers, speakers and workshop facilitators. With the help of the active community involved we felt that the possibility to make this a high quality event was solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of us had to work full-time for two weeks divided over four months to make the project happen. Jenny was among those who shouldered this responsibility. To run the actual event we needed about eight people taken from core members of Sparvn&auml;stet and also volunteers in our extended networks for things like providing hardware and cooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We planned everything on Tuesdays at our weekly meetings at Hemliga Tr&auml;dg&aring;rden in Midsommarkransen, Stockholm and also on specific days by appointment. Central to the planning was the Sparvn&auml;set IRC channel. Tasks could be divided and feedback from meetings with the museum could be handled in the channel. Persons in the group used their network to contact lecturers and workshop facilitators and we made a call for volunteers in our extended circle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invited people from other cities to give lectures or workshops. We paid their tickets out of our own pockets and also opened up the informal economy of lending apartments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To further spread the event we published a website at make-all.se and blogged about the event at sparvnastet.org. We advertised the event via personal e-mail, various IRC channels and to tech-related groups such as GeekGirl. We also reached out to a larger audience through invitations and information at services like Facebook and Twitter. The museum made a press release and public announcements on the museum website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the event one of us was interviewed on national radio, a small notice appeared in one of the national newspapers and there was also a longer interview in Stockholm fria tidning. Some presentations were streamed and also accessible after the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With lectures on anonymization and net politics, workshops in Arduino, lock picking and web development for activists, open tables for exploring techniques and sharing knowledge &ldquo;make-all&rdquo; was a way to manifest and open up the extended creative hacker culture in Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A practical Intensity - the actual event</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will now share some of my diary-notes from the actual event. People from Sparvn&auml;set are named by their IRC nicknames. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event is self-organized. Nobody except the staff of the museum is paid and people work and participate on a voluntary basis. It is part of the logic to keep the event open and free of charge. The fact that money is not involved helps create a non-hierarchical structure and seems to make it easy for people to join. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thursday In this big assemblage of people and technology, movement is needed. I begin with taking the public transport to the museum with a lot of things that were prepared in the weeks before: the sponsored Arduinos, LED-throwies kit, Wallman kits, the hand painted &ldquo;make all&rdquo; flag, a Go-board, walkie talkies, a print frame for the &ldquo;make all&rdquo; logo and color for t-shirt printing, soldering stations, an old laptop to be used for streaming, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Halfway there I meet up with other Sparvn&auml;stet members, Map and Jenny and they help me carry everything. At the museum we meet up with Nils Olander and the museum technician, and the group begins to work setting it all up. Coordination is minimal and informal, no division of tasks is needed, and things just get done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel the power of the networked agency, we interact in sync, almost as in a trance, filling in where other left of, almost dancing and in professional collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The space is an old white painted stable with pillars and chandeliers in the high ceilings. By arranging chairs and tables we divide the room into two parts: one part is dedicated to open projects and workshops and the other to presentations at the stage. It is a conscious division between the more formal and a more informal sphere to open the room for a range of activities. There is a flow that comes from the moment. Spirit, resources and ambition. We &ldquo;make all&rdquo; happen easily, because there is skill and determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The large batch of Club Mate, the hacker beverage that has a great symbolic significance, is lost somewhere between Germany and Stockholm. We hope that it will find its way in time tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friday Cat fetches me by car in the morning to go pick up Adis with the party tents. At the museum we unpack the sponsored Arduino kits with great joy. Continuing on where we left of yesterday, we set up the party tent in the yard and soldering stations, Map tests the streaming possibilities, Cat makes another trip by car to get the food for the event that Suss has prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back at the museum Byo hooks up every table with power and plugs. 4zm set up an old Amiga computer for some old school games. Map writes a small program to control the programmable light. I set up a projector to project some visuals. Suss starts preparations for food. The whole place boils with initiative. The lost Club Mate arrives. We get an email from someone who will give some Android phones for all to play with, Map sets up his time-lapse equipment and Adis a server to hand streaming. The crazy assemblage of the event comes together over a special kind of confidence and concentrated fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the first guests arrive at six o&rsquo;clock everything is kind of set. First up is Dee who just adds to the group. She unpacks an Eggbot, a Raspberry pie and a bunch of other fun stuff from a giant suitcase on one of the large tables in the middle of the room. She starts to assemble the Eggbot that can print on round things. People from the Malm&ouml; and G&ouml;teborg hackerspaces arrive, setting up their projects; some more shady. More people from Sparvn&auml;stet join. Hanging out is mixed with individual projects, Vojd makes software for an Arduino instrument, Jwalk and others fold paper space origami, a homemade Geiger meter clicks on the table, 4zm repairs the joystick port of the Amiga computer with help from others. With a sleeping bag I find one of the corners in the room, lazily watching the continued fun that continues into the night before I fall asleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturday Wake up, numb body, hard floor. There were around 20 people at the pre-hack last night; even if the turnout was not too large the people who showed up lived it up. Nils from the museum who also slept over is very happy about all the people that bring initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main day of the event starts slow and we become increasingly concerned about the turnout, the moment of truth. But people are really starting to pour in after lunch. 4zm presents &ldquo;make all&rdquo; and we open the official program. The first talk is by Snuggl on graphics processing units (GPUs), shaders and floating-point calculations and how the OpenGL API works. We then continue with a packed Arduino workshop held by Hedvig Kamp and a web publishing workshop for activists held by Plan. On the white pillars in the large room, there is a hacker quiz; any means to win is encouraged. Outside in the courtyard the party tent is busy with various kinds of activities during the event, screen printing t-shirts, kids learning soldering by making LED-throwies, an ad-hoc circuit bending workshop, other random projects and food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initiated people take part in various activities, but although few in numbers, some of the ordinary museum visitors is struggling to find a way to engage, one or two even turning at the entrance. As organizers, we fail a bit because the pedagogical explanation that we have is not enough to motivate the uncommitted and to close the gap. It&rsquo;s hard to bridge the knowledge divide with information or instructions because of the limited attention span, anxiety and skill-level of the non-initiated visitor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A slightly older and curious man asks what he can do and how the event works beyond talks. The workshops are open and relatively easy to engage in if you have some basic skills and interest. The open table area creates small groups that engage in their own or collaborative projects. It is clear that it is important to come prepared and motivated in order to engage in practical matter directly. &ldquo;make all&rdquo; provides a span of low and high threshold activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way to learn here is to touch and explore things as they are in front of you. Getting there can be a struggle. In this way the children&rsquo;s attitude can lead the way. Some children play with a robot bug on the floor, I can see that they commit totally, lost in activity and play. As a contrast, others get lost in the ideas of the ordinary museum visitor and look for specific directions and instructions of what to do. The situation is an allegory on how to learn by exploring, of institutional fail, imposing of lost guidance and how unprepared un-readiness separates the visitor from the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The talks continue into the afternoon with an introduction by Phyx about locks and how keys work. After this many people gather around the lock picking table to have a go at the locks. The lock picking really works as a great example of a low threshold activity, as all you have to do is just join in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evening approaches Martin Millnert gives a talk on how the backbone of internet works and Andreas Jonsson talks about the Tor project with a joint workshop of how to set up a Tor relay. Submarine and Monki make a practical workshop on how to make 3D objects cardboard models side by side with a workshop on how to hack public transport NFC (Near Field Communication) cards. The NFC workshop is a good example of a high threshold activity as special hardware, software, a laptop and special knowledge is needed. As with many hacking explorations, the exploration is done in a legal gray zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lecture program ends late in the evening with a less technical presentation by Monki on the so-called Hot Line riots. In 1982, a bug in the phone system was used to create unauthorized hotlines. Spontaneous gatherings of young adults in the inner city of Stockholm lead to confrontations with the police. 30 years later the Hot Line riots can be put in perspective of the current technological context and networked disturbance like the so-called Instagram riots in G&ouml;teborg in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people from the circuit bending workshop suddenly enter the stage and hold a noise concert. The high volume of this concert gradually leads to people vacating the premises and most of the inner circle hit the &ldquo;make all&rdquo; party at Solna HQ. Others are left to close for the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunday We pick up our stuff. Everybody at Sparvn&auml;stet seem very happy with how &ldquo;make all&rdquo; went down. It was a success and the event attracted around 250 participants, a very versatile and fun crowd. An evaluation with the museum is scheduled for later. At a brief meeting we decide to continue with a series of workshops on the art of exploitation and Arduino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commentary Bridge the gap An interesting way to think about &ldquo;make all&rdquo; is to look at it from the dichotomy of the private and the public and follow sometimes conflicting oscillations between the museum and Sparvn&auml;stet. How the semi-private community of Sparvn&auml;stet when it makes the event, expands into a public space. And how the public museum makes a reversed journey into the semi-private community of Sparvn&auml;stets extended network. In this process the manifest and the hidden come into play as strategies to smooth the transition between the practical hacker event and the public image of it. One example is how the process of decoding the hacker context makes certain things and activities available but still concealed at the actual event. With the process of decoding, semi-private discourses can be preserved in the public event. The practical event as a manifestation in space enables a big range of activities and possibilities where the informal and the formal coexist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The activities are seen from different perspectives and are dependent on the level of skill and interest a person has. There are things that could never be part of the program but that are part of the event as a hidden informal possibility. One example is the chance to explore the gray zone of the NFC workshop. Although these hidden possibilities are necessary for the event to be successful and fun for the more initiated crowd, they do not fit the formal program. On the other side of the spectrum we as organizers need to help with the decoding, to bridge the gap and lower the threshold in order to reach a larger audience. At the same time we know that too much explanation or public light may cause some people not to show up. It is a fine balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the evaluation after the event, Sparvn&auml;stet reflected on the difficulties in handling the various skill and interest levels of the crowd. There is a difference in how people engage the space: by guidance or spontaneously, from a distance or close, with a consumer / voyeur attitude or with participatory engagement. Initiated persons who know the codes of engagement were compared with the people from the general public where a certain amount of explanation was required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As organizers one goal had been to see if we could increase the willingness to engage, but in this regard Sparvn&auml;stet expressed a shortcoming. We were not always able to bridge the knowledge divide. As there was a limited time window for pedagogical explanation, lost translation was inevitable in some cases. We concluded that information could have been better, but were still unsure if this would reduce the gap and motivate people to start exploring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The relationship between pedagogical explanation and participation is one of the realizations of the overall objective defined in the application. We stated that the event would give people new skills and enable decisions on how to use the Internet in a more informed way. The event provided this to a large extent through talks combined with workshops for practical implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hacker agency The frustration of not being able to bridge the knowledge gap can be seen in light of yet another convergence, how the public usually interprets the hacker agency. Public media describes hacking as a illegal malicious activity. In fact hacker exploration is vital for democratization and participation processes in a technology dependent society, because it questions otherwise hidden agendas and processes. Without the perspective and knowledge of the hacker our society would be more closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sparvn&auml;stet opens up a closed community but in the process has to try to convince the public of this point of view. We want to create an acceptance for hacker culture and identity but also maintain its radical nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One strategy to smoothen a potential conflict with the public is shown in how the museum handles and cutifies the press release (as described above). The museum rubs the edges of exploration off to make the event more acceptable in the public eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different strategies from manifest messages to withdrawal tactics are used to try to make the meeting between the hackers and the public happen, oscillating between frustration and vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also in regard to the private / public, hidden / manifest discussion Sparvn&auml;stet acknowledged the possibility to ignore public media. We didn't want to focus on a negative image, but to focus as much as possible on the more initiated process and interpretation of the hacker agency. This is a semi-private positioning where Sparvn&auml;stet does not feel the need to explain and where the withdrawal is seen as an opportunity to open up a more internal dialog. The pedagogical process of explanation in this case opens up for vulnerability and possible misunderstanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ideological conflict around the word hacker did break through in a radio interview that we decided to participate in one day before the event. The interviewer really confirmed the general notion of the hacker with a question about the supposed malicious intent of hackers. Vojd from Sparvn&auml;stet answered that a hacker is someone who creates and starts important processes through exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one example of how the discourse of creativity is established and how norms of creativity and the transgressive nature of creativity come into conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hacking and creativity The process of hacking can be seen as creating a path in a field of possibilities. Make a smooth space out of a striated space, to use the words of Gilles Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari from Mille Plateaus (1980). The hack, literally, bridges a space of possibilities that was not possible prior to the hack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creativity like this changes spatial possibilities. The rearrangement will sometimes contest the power within the space. To clean the space and divide it between safe zones of private and public property, an entrepreneurial smoothing can be put into motion, perfect from the point of view of the liberal innovator and the maker. But there is also a more transgressive creativity where conflicts, grey zones, on different levels enable the making of a smoother path for the hacker and net activist. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> Hackers and makers With &ldquo;make all&rdquo; two different genealogies were established. The museum seems to use &ldquo;make all&rdquo; as a project where they can test their agenda to establish a science center with experimental workshops and produce maker fairs. Sparvn&auml;stet wants to manifest the hacker community and also has a political agenda relating to social change and network awareness. The genealogies actually add to two different conflicting narratives. On one hand, the hacker and net-activist aiming for social change, on the other the maker and entrepreneur questing for innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the maker agency, social change seems to be a supplement. In the agency of the hacker it seems to be an essential pathway. The maker agency is of a more moderate character because it can exist without any conflicts to existing powers. The hacker is an information freedom anarchist and opposes and goes into conflict with systems that restricts the user&rsquo;s freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might be to overstate the difference but it is substantial how the maker and the hacker are used as agencies. In relation to the public, the maker seems to be more open and maybe nice however also with strategies to make things and processes private property. On the other hand the hacker seems to be more private but also surrounded by strategies to make information and things more public and open. Perhaps there are two different motions here, one inward and one outward between the public and the private.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea must be refined later but the maker could be seen as a vehicle of cleaning processes where the conflicts are put aside. This then produces an non-political agency that can easily be made part of a liberal public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conflict is solved temporarily by the concrete nature of the event with experimentation and exploration as the common denominator. Between the two narratives praxis establishes a middle ground as it is seen as key to bridging knowledge: by exploration, in the workshop, at the workstation, probing, tinker, making - hacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain these differences was important, but to strategically ignore them was key to making the event happen. Knowing the temporal nature of the event, it was possible to do so, however continued collaboration with the museum was to be more of a stretch. This is something I will return to later as Sparvn&auml;stet and the museum consider more collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workload On the event floor and during the process of realizing event I felt trust and confidence in the group, who worked without any explicit hierarchy like a distributed network. The voluntary and self-organizing model seems to be very efficient, and the project was a large assembly of skills and a great accomplishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In retrospect Sparvn&auml;stet concluded that the work-pressure for the persons who took main responsibility was sometimes a bit too hard. In ad hoc organizations key figures have to step up and sometimes shoulder the responsibility in an un-proportional way. While it can be rewarding to lead, we agreed that strategies for sharing this responsibility could have been better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a small group of thoughtful and committed people decide to make something happen, anything is possible to accomplish. At the same time the members of the group are dependent on one another. It is possible to create intensity but in the process rest is also necessary. The low redundancy/high dependency level is a risk factor in such projects and models of organization as well as a stress factor for the most involved individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Issues At the retrospect with the museum we all seem to agree that we want to make &ldquo;make-all&rdquo; an annual event. This however was a temporary success. It turns out that we are not able to combine the radical nature of the Sparvn&auml;stet principle with the maker path of the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can we interpret this and further iterate the relationship between the maker and the hacker? This can be compared to, for example, how free software was turned into &ldquo;open source&rdquo;. I also want to explore strategies of privatization and public exploitation, especially in regard to the artist agency. One example is baiting people with openness and common processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the ad-hoc organization model works, we concluded that the strategies for sharing responsibility should have been better. The division of tasks in voluntary work can be unclear. Is it possible to find a way to even out the burden and reward without putting control mechanism in place that stifle the easy way to join? This could add to the overall question of my research on how to create and scale distributed knowledge models. Do organizations that depend heavily on key persons need another kind of model or can this limitation be resolved by my further exploration?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To expand this question to a wider context of work and art: the voluntary nature of our engagement should be noted as being possible because we get our income from other sources. Voluntarism in creative industries can be a way to exploit mostly young people. How does voluntarism relate to the models I am exploring?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event had a relatively differentiated crowd, but 100% of the talks were held by men and up to 60% of the workshops were facilitated by men. We put in special effort into finding female speakers, but it was difficult. How can we find more concrete ways to actively create more diversity?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In relation to the installations that are specified as the final outcome of my artist research, is there a contradiction in the participatory format of &ldquo;make all&rdquo;? My method is performative; meaning that I will engage in the practice rather than represent it. But in making installations, does that mean that I have to I step out of the circle of participation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Keywords Information, hacking, Internet, workshops, education, knowledge dissemination, DIY, hackspace</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To Share Hedvigs lecture notes.

Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions of United States politics, including the politics of socialist feminism. Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting on the need for community. Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true. Irony is about humour and serious play. It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honoured within socialist-feminism. At the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg.\r\n\r\nA cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction. The international women's movements have constructed 'women's experience', as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion.\r\n\r\nContemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs \u2014 creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted. Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality. Cyborg 'sex' restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism). Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a dream of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I, command-control-communication-intelligence, an $84 billion item in 1984's US defence budget. I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. Michael Foucault's biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open field.\r\n\r\nBy the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs. Ths cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation. In the traditions of 'Western' science and politics \u2014 the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other \u2014 the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This chapter is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction. It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. The cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history. Nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar, attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse. As Zoe Sofoulis argues in her unpublished manuscript on Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and nuclear culture, Lacklein, the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival.\r\n\r\nThe cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity. In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story in the Western sense \u2014 a 'final' irony since the cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic telos of the 'West's' escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. An origin story in the 'Western', humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis, in their concepts of labour and of individuation and gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature. The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western sense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology as star wars.\r\n\r\nThe cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. No longer structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines a technological polls based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. The rela-tionships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the hopes of Frankenstein's monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city and cosmos. The eyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if eyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary of holism, but needy for connection- they seem to have a natural feel for united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential.\r\n\r\nI will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this chapter, but now I want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the following political-fictional (political-scientific) analysis possible. By the late twentieth century in United States scientific culture, the boundary between human and animal is thoroughly breached. The last beachheads of uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks--language tool use, social behaviour, mental events, nothing really convincingly settles the separation of human and animal. And many people no longer feel the need for such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm the pleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. Movements for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are a clear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach of nature and culture. Biology and evolutionary theory over the last two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social science. Within this framework, teaching modern Christian creationism should be fought as a form of child abuse.\r\n\r\nBiological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scientific culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much room for radical political people to contest the meanings of the breached boundary.2 The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed. Far from signalling a walling off of people from other living beings, cyborgs signal distrurbingly and pleasurably tight coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange.\r\n\r\nThe second leaky distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine. Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the spectre of the ghost in the machine. This dualism structured the dialogue between materialism and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man's dream, only mock it. They were not man, an author to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist reproductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid. Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and art)ficial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.\r\n\r\nTechnological determination is only one ideological space opened up by the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we engage in the play of writing and reading the world.3 'Textualization' of everything in poststructuralist, postmodernist theory has been damned by Marxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disregard for the lived relations of domination that ground the 'play' of arbitrary reading.4 It is certainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert myriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the biological organism). In short, the certainty of what counts as nature \u2014 a source of insight and promise of innocence \u2014 is undermined, probably fatally. The transcendent authorization of interpretation is lost, and with it the ontology grounding 'Western' epistemology. But the alternative is not cynicism or faithlessness, that is, some version of abstract existence, like the accounts of technological determinism destroying 'man' by the 'machine' or 'meaningful political action' by the 'text'. Who cyborgs will be is a radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. Both chimpanzees and artefacts have politics, so why shouldn't we (de Waal, 1982; Winner, 1980)?\r\n\r\nThe third distinction is a subset of the second: the boundary between physical and non-physical is very imprecise for us. Pop physics books on the consequences of quantum theory and the indeterminacy principle are a kind of popular scientific equivalent to Harlequin romances* as a marker of radical change in American white heterosexuality: they get it wrong, but they are on the right subject. Modern machines are quintessentially microelectronic devices: they are everywhere and they are invisible. Modern machinery is an irreverent upstart god, mocking the Father's ubiquity and spirituality. The silicon chip is a surface for writing; it is etched in molecular scales disturbed only by atomic noise, the ultimate interference for nuclear scores. Writing, power, and technology are old partners in Western stories of the origin of civilization, but miniaturization has changed our experience of mechanism. Miniaturization has turned out to be about power; small is not so much beautiful as pre-eminently dangerous, as in cruise missiles. Contrast the TV sets of the 1950s or the news cameras of the 1970s with the TV wrist bands or hand-sized video cameras now advertised. Our best machines are made of sunshine; they are all light and clean because they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum, and these machines are eminently portable, mobile \u2014 a matter of immense human pain in Detroit and Singapore. People are nowhere near so fluid, being both material and opaque. Cyborgs are ether, quintessence.\r\n\r\nThe ubiquity and invisibility of cyborgs is precisely why these sunshine-belt machines are so deadly. They are as hard to see politically as materially. They are about consciousness \u2014 or its simulation.5 They are floating signIfiers moving in pickup trucks across Europe, blocked more effectively by the witch-weavings of the displaced and so unnatural Greenham women, who read the cyborg webs of power so very well, than by the militant labour of older masculinist politics, whose natural constituency needs defence jobs. Ultimately the 'hardest' science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the realm of pure number, pure spirit, C3I, cryptography, and the preservation of potent secrets. The new machines are so clean and light. Their engineers are sun-worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution associated with the night dream of post-industrial society. The diseases evoked by these clean machines are 'no more' than the minuscule coding changes of an antigen in the immune system, 'no more' than the experience of stress. The nimble fingers of 'Oriental' women, the old fascination of little Anglo-Saxon Victorian girls with doll's houses, women's enforced attention to the small take on quite new dimensions in this world. There might be a cyborg Alice taking account of these new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita jail2 whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies.\r\nSo my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formula-tions, and physical artefacts associated with 'high technology' and scientific culture. From One-DimensionalMan (Marcuse, 1964) to The Death of Nature (Merchant, 1980), the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies.\r\n\r\nFrom one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (Sofia, 1984). From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many-headed monsters. Cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate; in our present political circumstances, we could hardly hope for more potent myths for resistance and recoupling. I like to imagine LAG, the Livermore Action Group, as a kind of cyborg society, dedicated to realistically converting the laboratories that most fiercely embody and spew out the tools\r\n\r\nOf technological apocalypse, and committed to building a political form that acutally manages to hold together witches, engineers, elders, perverts, Christians, mothers, and Leninists long enough to disarm the state. Fission Impossible is the name of the affinity group in my town.(Affinity: related not by blood but by choice, the appeal of one chemical nuclear group for another, avidiy.)6\r\n\r\nFractured identities\r\nIt has become difficult to name one's feminism by a single adjective \u2014 or even to insist in every circumstance upon the noun. Consciousness of exclusion through naming is acute. Identities seem contradictory, partial, and strategic. With the hard-won recognition of their social and historical constitution, gender, race, and class cannot provide the basis for belief in 'essential' unity. There is nothing about teeing 'female' that naturally binds women. There is not even such a state as 'being' female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement forced on us by the terrible historica experience of the contradictory social realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism. And who counts as 'us' in my own rhetoric? Which identities are available to ground such a potent political myth called 'us', and what could motivate enlistment in this collectivity? Painful fragmentation among feminists (not to mention among women) along every possible fault line has made the concept of woman elusive, an excuse for the matrix of women's dominations of each other. For me \u2014 and for many who share a similar historical location in white, professional middle-class, female, radical, North American, mid-adult bodies \u2014 the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition \u2014 affinity, not identity.7\r\n\r\nChela Sandoval (n.d., 1984), from a consideration of specific historical moments in the formation of the new political voice called women of colour, has theorized a hopeful model of political identity called 'oppositional consciousness', born of the skills for reading webs of power by those refused stable membership in the social categories of race, sex, or class. 'Women of color', a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorporate, as well as a historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all the signs of Man in 'Western' traditions, constructs a kind of postmodernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity. This postmodernist identity is fully political, whatever might be said abut other possible postmodernisms. Sandoval's oppositional consciousness is about contradictory locations and heterochronic calendars, not about relativisms and pluralisms.\r\n\r\nSandoval emphasizes the lack of any essential criterion for identifying who is a woman of colour. She notes that the definition of the group has been by conscious appropriation of negation. For example, a Chicana or US black woman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person or as a Chicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative identities, left out of even the privileged oppressed authorial categories called 'women and blacks', who claimed to make the important revolutions. The category 'woman' negated all non-white women; 'black' negated all non-black people, as well as all black women. But there was also no 'she', no singularity, but a sea of differences among US women who have affirmed their historical identity as US women of colour. This identity marks out a self-consciously constructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of natural identification, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of affinity, of political kinship.8 Unlike the 'woman' of some streams of the white women's movement in the United States, there is no naturalization of the matrix, or at least this is what Sandoval argues is uniquely available through the power of oppositional consciousness.\r\n\r\nSandoval's argument has to be seen as one potent formulation for feminists out of the world-wide development of anti-colonialist discourse; that is to say, discourse dissolving the 'West' and its highest product \u2014 the one who is not animal, barbarian, or woman; man, that is, the author of a cosmos called history. As orientalism is deconstructed politically and semiotically, the identities of the occident destabilize, including those of feminists.9 Sandoval argues that 'women of colour' have a chance to build an effective unity that does not replicate the imperializing, totalizing revolutionary subjects of previous Marxisms and feminisms which had not faced the consequences of the disorderly polyphony emerging from decolonization.\r\nKatie King has emphasized the limits of identification and the political/ poetic mechanics of identification built into reading 'the poem', that generative core of cultural feminism. King criticizes the persistent tendency among contemporary feminists from different 'moments' or 'conversations' in feminist practice to taxonomize the women's movement to make one's own political tendencies appear to be the telos of the whole. These taxonomies tend to remake feminist history so that it appears to be an ideological struggle among coherent types persisting over time, especially those typical units called radical, liberal, and socialist-feminism. Literally, all other feminisms are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building an explicit ontology and epistemology.10 Taxonomies of feminism produce epistemologies to police deviation from official women's experience. And of course, 'women's culture', like women of colour, is consciously created by mechanisms inducing affinity. The rituals of poetry, music, and certain forms of academic practice have been pre-eminent. The politics of race and culture in the US women's movements are intimately interwoven. The common achievement of King and Sandoval is learning how to craft a poetic/political unity without relying on a logic of appropriation, incorporation, and taxonomic identification.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical and practical struggle against unity-through-domination or unity-through-incorporation ironically not only undermines the justifica-tions for patriarchy, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essentialism, scient-ism, and other unlamented -isms, but all claims for an organic or natural standpoint. I think that radical and socialist/Marxist-feminisms have also undermined their/our own epistemological strategies and that this is a crucially valuable step in imagining possible unities. It remains to be seen whether all 'epistemologies' as Western political people have known them fail us in the task to build effective affinities.\r\nIt is important to note that the effort to construct revolutionary stand-points, epistemologies as achievements of people committed to changing the world, has been part of the process showing the limits of identification. The acid tools of postmodernist theory and the constructive tools of ontological discourse about revolutionary subjects might be seen as ironic allies in dissolving Western selves in the interests of survival. We are excruciatingly conscious of what it means to have a historically constituted body. But with the loss of innocence in our origin, there is no expulsion from the Garden either. Our politics lose the indulgence of guilt with the naivete of innocence. But what would another political myth for socialist-feminism look like? What kind of politics could embrace partial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful, effective \u2014 and, ironically, socialist-feminist?\r\nI do not know of any other time in history when there was greater need for political unity to confront effectively the dominations of 'race', 'gender', 'sexuality', and 'class'. I also do not know of any other time when the kind of unity we might help build could have been possible. None of 'us' have any longer the symbolic or material capability of dictating the shape of reality to any of'them'. Or at least 'we' cannot claim innocence from practicing such dominations. White women, including socialist feminists, discovered (that is, were forced kicking and screaming to notice) the non-innocence of the category 'woman'. That consciousness changes the geography of all previous categories; it denatures them as heat denatures a fragile protein. Cyborg feminists have to argue that 'we' do not want any more natural matrix of unity and that no construction is whole. Innocence, and the corollary insistence on victimhood as the only ground for insight, has done enough damage. But the constructed revolutionary subject must give late-twentieth-century people pause as well. In the fraying of identities and in the reflexive strategies for constructing them, the possibility opens up for weaving something other than a shroud for the day after the apocalypse that so prophetically ends salvation history.\r\n\r\nBoth Marxist/socialist-feminisms and radical feminisms have simul-taneously naturalized and denatured the category 'woman' and conscious-ness of the social lives of 'women'. Perhaps a schematic caricature can highlight both kinds of moves. Marxian socialism is rooted in an analysis of wage labour which reveals class structure. The consequence of the wage relationship is systematic alienation, as the worker is dissociated from his (sic) product. Abstraction and illusion rule in knowledge, domination rules in practice. Labour is the pre-eminently privileged category enabling the Marxist to overcome illusion and find that point of view which is necessary for changing the world. Labour is the humanizing activity that makes man; labour is an ontological category permitting the knowledge of a subject, and so the knowledge of subjugation and alienation.\r\n\r\nIn faithful filiation, socialist-feminism advanced by allying itself with the basic analytic strategies of Marxism. The main achievement of both Marxist feminists and socialist feminists was to expand the category of labour to accommodate what (some) women did, even when the wage relation was subordinated to a more comprehensive view of labour under capitalist patriarchy. In particular, women's labour in the household and women's activity as mothers generally (that is, reproduction in the socialist-feminist sense), entered theory on the authority of analogy to the Marxian concept of labour. The unity of women here rests on an epistemology based on the ontological structure of'labour'. Marxist/socialist-feminism does not 'natur-alize' unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint rooted in social relations. The essentializing move is in the ontological structure of labour or of its analogue, women's activity.11 The inheritance of Marxian humanism, with its pre-eminently Western self, is the difficulty for me. The contribution from these formulations has been the emphasis on the daily responsibility of real women to build unities, rather than to naturalize them.\r\n\r\nCatherine MacKinnon's (198Z, 1987) version of radical feminism is itself a caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies of Western theories of identity grounding action.12 It is factually and politically wrong to assimilate all of the diverse 'moments' or 'conversations' in recent women's politics named radical feminism to MacKinnon's version. But the teleological logic of her theory shows how an epistemology and ontology \u2014 including their negations \u2014 erase or police difference. Only one of the effects of MacKinnon's theory is the rewriting of the history of the polymorphous field called radical feminism. The major effect is the production of a theory of experience, of women's identity, that is a kind of apocalypse for all revolutionary standpoints. That is, the totalization built into this tale of radical feminism achieves its end \u2014 the unity of women \u2014 by enforcing the experience of and testimony to radical non-being. As for the Marxist/ socialist feminist, consciousness is an achievement, not a natural fact. And MacKinnon's theory eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist revolutionary subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism.\r\n\r\nMacKinnon argues that feminism necessarily adopted a different analyt-ical strategy from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class, but at the structure of sex/gender and its generative relationship, men's constitu-tion and appropriation of women sexually. Ironically, MacKinnon's 'ontology' constructs a non-subject, a non-being. Another's desire, not the self's labour, is the origin of 'woman'. She therefore develops a theory of consciousness that enforces what can count as 'women's' experience \u2014 anything that names sexual violation, indeed, sex itself as far as 'women' can be concerned. Feminist practice is the construction of this form of consciousness; that is, the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not.\r\n\r\nPerversely, sexual appropriation in this feminism still has the epistemolo-gical status of labour; that is to say, the point from which an analysis able to contribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual object)fication, not alienation, is the consequence of the structure of sex/gender. In the realm of knowledge, the result of sexual objectification is illusion and abstraction. However, a woman is not simply alienated from her product, but in a deep sense does not exist as a subject, or even potential subject, since she owes her existence as a woman to sexual appropriation. To be constituted by another's desire is not the same thing as to be alienated in the violent separation of the labourer from his product.\r\n\r\nMacKinnon's radical theory of experience is totalizing in the extreme; it does not so much marginalize as obliterate the authority of any other women's political speech and action. It is a totalization producing what Western patriarchy itself never succeeded in doing \u2014 feminists' consciousness of the non-existence of women, except as products of men's desire. I think MacKinnon correctly argues that no Marxian version of identity can firmly ground women's unity. But in solving the problem of the contradictions of any Western revolutionary subject for feminist purposes, she develops an even more authoritarian doctrine of experience. If my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice, MacKinnon's intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the 'essential' non-existence of women is not reassuring.\r\n\r\nIn my taxonomy, which like any other taxonomy is a re-inscription of history, radical feminism can accommodate all the activities of women named by socialist feminists as forms of labour only if the activity can somehow be sexualized. Reproduction had different tones of meanings for the two tendencies, one rooted in labour, one in sex, both calling the consequences of domination and ignorance of social and personal reality 'false consciousness'.\r\n\r\nBeyond either the diff~culties or the contributions in the argument of any one author, neither Marxist nor radical feminist points of view have tended to embrace the status of a partial explanation; both were regularly constituted as totalities. Western explanation has demanded as much; how else could the 'Western' author incorporate its others? Each tried to annex other forms of domination by expanding its basic categories through analogy, simple listing, or addition. Embarrassed silence about race among white radical and socialist feminists was one major, devastating political consequence. History and polyvocality disappear into political taxonomies that try to establish genealogies. There was no structural room for race (or for much else) in theory claiming to reveal the construction of the category woman and social group women as a unified or totalizable whole. The structure of my caricature looks like this:\r\nsocialist feminism--structure of class // wage labour // alienation labour, by analogy reproduction, by extension sex, by addition race radical feminism \u2014 structure of gender // sexual appropriation // objectification] sex, by analogy labour, by extension reproduction, by addition race\r\nIn another context, the French theorist, Julia Kristeva, claimed women appeared as a historical group after the Second World War, along with groups like youth. Her dates are doubtful; but we are now accustomed to remembering that as objects of knowledge and as historical actors, 'race' did not always exist, 'class' has a historical genesis, and 'homosexuals' are quite junior. It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man \u2014 and so the essence of woman \u2014 breaks up at the same moment that networks of connection among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple, pregnant, and complex. 'Advanced capitalism' is inadequate to convey the structure of this historical moment. In the 'Western' sense, the end of man is at stake. It is no accident that woman disintegrates into women in our time. Perhaps socialist feminists were not substantially guilty of producing essentialist theory that suppressed women's particularity and contradictory interests. I think we have been, at least through unreflective participation in the logics, languages, and practices of white humanism and through searching for a single ground of domination to secure our revolutionary voice. Now we have less excuse. But in the consciousness of our failures, we risk lapsing into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing task of making partial, real connection. Some differences are playful; some are poles of world historical systems of domination. 'Epistemology' is about knowing the difference.\r\n\r\nTHE INFORMATICS OF DOMINATION\r\nIn this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch is set by the extent and importance of rearrangements in world-wide social relations tied to science and technology. I argue for a politics rooted in claims about fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging system of world order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created by industrial capitalism; we are living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information system--from all work to all play, a deadly game. Simultaneously material and ideological, the dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions from the comfortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks I have called the informatics of domination:\r\nRepresentation\r\nSimulation\r\nBourgeois novel, realism\r\nScience fiction, postmodernism\r\nOrganism\r\nBiotic Component\r\nDepth, integrity\r\nSurface, boundary\r\nHeat\r\nNoise\r\nBiology as clinical practice\r\nBiology as inscription\r\nPhysiology\r\nCommunications engineering\r\nSmall group\r\nSubsystem\r\nPerfection\r\nOptimization\r\nEugenics\r\nPopulation Control\r\nDecadence, Magic Mountain\r\nObsolescence, Future Shock\r\nHygiene\r\nStress Management\r\nMicrobiology, tuberculosis\r\nImmunology, AIDS\r\nOrganic division of labour\r\nErgonomics/cybernetics of labour\r\nFunctional specialization\r\nModular construction\r\nReproduction\r\nReplication\r\nOrganic sex role specialization\r\nOptimal genetic strategies\r\nBioogical determinism\r\nEvolutionary inertia, constraints\r\nCommunity ecology\r\nEcosystem\r\nRacial chain of being\r\nNeo-imperialism, United Nations humanism\r\nScientific management in home/factory\r\nGlobal factory/Electronid cottage\r\nFamily/Market/Factory\r\nWomen in the Integrated Circuit\r\nFamily wage\r\nComparable worth\r\nPublic/Private\r\nCyborg citizenship\r\nNature/Culture\r\nfields of difference\r\nCo-operation\r\nCommunicatins enhancemenet\r\nFreud\r\nLacan\r\nSex\r\nGenetic engineering\r\nlabour\r\nRobotics\r\nMind\r\nArtificial Intelligence\r\nSecond World War\r\nStar Wars\r\nWhite Capitalist Patriarchy\r\nInformatics of Domination\r\nThis list suggests several interesting things.13 First, the objects on the right-hand side cannot be coded as 'natural', a realization that subverts naturalistic coding for the left-hand side as well. We cannot go back ideologically or materially. It's not just that igod'is dead; so is the 'goddess'. Or both are revivified in the worlds charged with microelectronic and biotechnological politics. In relation to objects like biotic components, one must not think in terms of essential properties, but in terms of design, boundary constraints, rates of flows, systems logics, costs of lowering constraints. Sexual reproduction is one kind of reproductive strategy among many, with costs and benefits as a function of the system environment. Ideologies of sexual reproduction can no longer reasonably call on notions of sex and sex role as organic aspects in natural objects like organisms and families. Such reasoning will be unmasked as irrational, and ironically corporate executives reading Playboy and anti-porn radical feminists will make strange bedfellows in jointly unmasking the irrationalism.\r\n\r\nLikewise for race, ideologies about human diversity have to be formulated in terms of frequencies of parameters, like blood groups or intelligence scores. It is 'irrational' to invoke concepts like primitive and civilized. For liberals and radicals, the search for integrated social systems gives way to a new practice called 'experimental ethnography' in which an organic object dissipates in attention to the play of writing. At the level of ideology, we see translations of racism and colonialism into languages of development and under-development, rates and constraints of modernization. Any objects or persons can be reasonably thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly; no 'natural' architectures constrain system design. The financial districts in all the world's cities, as well as the export-processing and free-trade zones, proclaim this elementary fact of'late capitalism'. The entire universe of objects that can be known scientifically must be formulated as problems in communications engineering (for the managers) or theories of the text (for those who would resist). Both are cyborg semiologies.\r\nOne should expect control strategies to concentrate on boundary conditions and interfaces, on rates of flow across boundaries \u2014 and not on the integrity of natural objects. 'Integrity' or 'sincerity' of the Western self gives way to decision procedures and expert systems. For example, control strategies applied to women's capacities to give birth to new human beings will be developed in the languages of population control and maximization of goal achievement for individual decision-makers. Control strategies will be formulated in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of freedom. Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for processing signals in a common language. Exchange in this world transcends the universal translation effected by capitalist markets that Marx analysed so well. The privileged pathology affecting all kinds of components in this universe is stress \u2014 communications breakdown (Hogness, 1983). The cyborg is not subject to Foucault's biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics, a much more potent field of operations.\r\n\r\nThis kind of analysis of scientific and cultural objects of knowledge which have appeared historically since the Second World War prepares us to notice some important inadequacies in feminist analysis which has proceeded as if the organic, hierarchical dualisms ordering discourse in 'the West' since Aristotle still ruled. They have been cannibalized, or as Zoe Sofia (Sofoulis) might put it, they have been 'techno-digested'. The dichotomies between mind and body, animal and human, organism and machine, public and private, nature and culture, men and women, primitive and civilized are all in question ideologically. The actual situation of women is their integration/ exploitation into a world system of production/reproduction and com-munication called the informatics of domination. The home, workplace, market, public arena, the body itself- all can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite, polymorphous ways, with large consequences for women and others \u2014 consequences that themselves are very different for different people and which make potent oppositional international movements difficult to imagine and essential for survival. One important route for reconstructing socialist-feminist politics is through theory and practice addressed to the social relations of science and technology, including crucially the systems of myth and meanings structuring our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code.\r\n\r\nCommunications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations for women world-wide. Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments, of the fluid social interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as instruments for enforcing meanings. The boundary is permeable between tool and myth, instrument and concept, historical systems of social relations and historical anatomies of possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth and tool mutually constitute each other.\r\nFurthermore, communications sciences and modern biologies are constructed by a common move \u2014 the translation of the world into a problem of coding, a search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange.\r\n\r\nIn communications sciences, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic (feedback-controlled) systems theories applied to telephone technology, computer design, weapons deployment, or data base construction and maintenance. In each case, solution to the key questions rests on a theory of language and control; the key operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of flow of a quantity called information. The world is subdivided by boundaries differentially permeable to information. Information is just that kind of quantifiable element (unit, basis of unity) which allows universal translation, and so unhindered instrumental power (called effective communication). The biggest threat to such power is interruption of communication. Any system breakdown is a function of stress. The fundamentals of this technology can be condensed into the metaphor C31, command-controlcommunication-intelligence, the military's symbol for its operations theory.\r\n\r\nIn modern biologies, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by molecular genetics, ecology, sociobiological evolutionary theory, and immunobiology. The organism has been translated into prob-lems of genetic coding and read-out. Biotechnology, a writing technology, informs research broadly.14 In a sense, organisms have ceased to exist as objects of knowledge, giving way to biotic components, i.e., special kinds of information-processing devices. The analogous moves in ecology could be examined by probing the history and utility of the concept of the ecosystem. Immunobiology and associated medical practices are rich exemplars of the privilege of coding and recognition systems as objects of knowledge, as constructions of bodily reality for us. Biology here is a kind of cryptography. Research is necessarily a kind of intelligence activity. Ironies abound. A stressed system goes awry; its communication processes break down; it fails to recognize the difference between self and other. Human babies with baboon hearts evoke national ethical perplexity \u2014 for animal rights activists at least as much as for the guardians of human purity. In the US gay men and intravenous drug users are the 'privileged' victims of an awful immune system disease that marks (inscribes on the body) confusion of boundaries and moral pollution (Treichler, 1987).\r\nBut these excursions into communications sciences and biology have been at a rarefied level; there is a mundane, largely economic reality to support my claim that these sciences and technologies indicate fundamental transforma-tions in the structure of the world for us. \r\n\r\nCommunications technologies depend on electronics. Modern states, multinational corporations, military power, welfare state apparatuses, satellite systems, political processes, fabrication of our imaginations, labour-control systems, medical construc-tions of our bodies, commercial pornography, the international division of labour, and religious evangelism depend intimately upon electronics. Micro-electronics is the technical basis of simulacra; that is, of copies without originals.\r\n\r\nMicroelectronics mediates the translations of labour into robotics and word processing, sex into genetic engineering and reproductive technologies, and mind into artificial intelligence and decision procedures. The new biotechnologies concern more than human reproducdon. Biology as a powerful engineering science for redesigning materials and processes has revolutionary implications for industry, perhaps most obvious today in areas of fermentadon, agriculture, and energy. Communicadons sciences and biology are construcdons of natural-technical objects of knowledge in which the difference between machine and organism is thoroughly blurred; mind, body, and tool are on very intimate terms. The 'multinational' material organization of the production and reproduction of daily life and the symbolic organization of the production and reproduction of culture and imagination seem equally implicated. The boundary-maintaining images of base and superstructure, public and private, or material and ideal never seemed more feeble.\r\n\r\nI have used Rachel Grossman's (1980) image of women in the integrated circuit to name the situation of women in a world so intimately restructured through the social relations of science and technology.15 I used the odd circumlocution, 'the social relations of science and technology', to indicate that we are not dealing with a technological determinism, but with a historical system depending upon structured relations among people. But the phrase should also indicate that science and technology provide fresh sources of power, that we need fresh sources of analysis and political action (Latour, 1984). Some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high-tech-facilitated social relations can make socialist-feminism more relevant to effective progressive politics.\r\n\r\nThe 'homework economy' outside 'the home'\r\nThe 'New Industrial Revolution' is producing a new world-wide working class, as well as new sexualities and ethnicities. The extreme mobility of capital and the emerging international division of labour are intertwined with the emergence of new collecdvities, and the weakening of familiar groupings. These developments are neither gender- nor race-neutral. White men in advanced industrial societies have become newly vulnerable to permanent job loss, and women are not disappearing from the job rolls at the same rates as men. It is not simply that women in Third World countries are the preferred labour force for the science-based multinationals in the export-processing sectors, particularly in electronics. The picture is more systematic and involves reproduction, sexuality, culture, consumphon, and producdon. In the prototypical Silicon Valley, many women's lives have been structured around employment in electronics-dependent jobs, and their intimate realities include serial heterosexual monogamy, negotiating childcare, distance from extended kin or most other forms of traditional community, a high likelihood of loneliness and extreme economic vulnerability as they age. The ethnic and racial diversity of women in Silicon Valley structures a microcosm of conflicting differences in culture, family, religion, education, and language.\r\n\r\nRichard Gordon has called this new situation the 'homework economy'.16 Although he includes the phenomenon of literal homework emerging in connecdon with electronics assembly, Gordon intends 'homework economy' to name a restructuring of work that broadly has the characteristics formerly ascribed to female jobs, jobs literally done only by women. Work is being redefined as both literally female and feminized, whether performed by men or women. To be feminized means to be made extremely vulnerable; able to be disassembled, reassembled, exploited as a reserve labour force; seen less as workers than as servers; subjected to dme arrangements on and off the paid job that make a mockery of a limited work day; leading an existence that always borders on being obscene, out of place, and reducible to sex. Deskilling is an old strategy newly applicable to formerly privileged workers. However, the homework economy does not refer only to large-scale deskilling, nor does it deny that new areas of high skill are emerging, even for women and men previously excluded from skilled employment. Rather, the concept indicates that factory, home, and market are integrated on a new scale and that the places of women are crucial \u2014 and need to be analysed for differences among women and for meanings for relations between men and women in various situations.\r\n\r\nThe homework economy as a world capitalist organizational structure is made possible by (not caused by) the new technologies. The success of the attack on relatively privileged, mostly white, men's unionized jobs is deaf to the power of the new communications technologies to integrate and control labour despite extensive dispersion and decentralization. The consequences of the new technologies are felt by women both in the loss of the family (male) wage (if they ever had access to this white privilege) and in the character of their own jobs, which are becoming capital-intensive; for example, office work and nursing.\r\n\r\nThe new economic and technological arrangements are also related to the collapsing welfare state and the ensuing intensification of demands on women to sustain daily life for themselves as well as for men, children, and old people. The feminization of poverty \u2014 generated by dismantling the welfare state, by the homework economy where stable jobs become the exception, and sustained by the expectation that women's wages will not be matched by a male income for the support of children \u2014 has become an urgent focus. The causes of various women-headed households are a function of race, class, or sexuality; but their increasing generality is a ground for coalitions of women on many issues. That women regularly sustain daily life partly as a funcdon of their enforced status as mothers is hardly new; the kind of integration with the overall capitalist and progressively war-based economy is new. The particular pressure, for example, on US black women, who have achieved an escape from (barely) paid domeshc service and who now hold clerical and similar jobs in large numbers, has large implicadons for condnued enforced black poverty with employment. Teenage women in industrializing areas of the Third World increasingly find themselves the sole or major source of a cash wage for their families, while access to land is ever more problemadc. These developments must have major consequences in the psychodynamics and politics of gender and race.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of three major stages of capitalism (commercial/ early industrial, monopoly, multinational) \u2014 tied to nationalism, imperialism, and multinationalism, and related to Jameson's three dominant aesthetic periods of realism, modernism, and postmodernism \u2014 I would argue that specific forms of families dialectically relate to forms of capital and to its political and cultural concomitants. Although lived problematically and unequally, ideal forms of these families might be schematized as (1) the patriarchal nuclear family, structured by the dichotomy between public and private and accompanied by the white bourgeois ideology of separate spheres and nineteenth-century Anglo-American bourgeois feminism; (2) the modern family mediated (or enforced) by the welfare state and institutions like the family wage, with a flowering of a-feminist heterosexual ideologies, including their radical versions represented in Greenwich Village around the First World War; and (3) the 'family' of the homework economy with its oxymoronic structure of women-headed households and its explosion of feminisms and the paradoxical intensification and erosion of gender itself.\r\n\r\nThis is the context in which the projections for world-wide structural unemployment stemming from the new technologies are part of the picture of the homework economy. As robodcs and related technologies put men out of work in 'developed' countries and exacerbate failure to generate male jobs in Third World 'development', and as the automated of fice becomes the rule even in labour-surplus countries, the feminization of work intensifies. Black women in the United States have long known what it looks like to face the structural underemployment ('feminization') of black men, as well as their own highly vulnerable position in the wage economy. It is no longer a secret that sexuality, reproduction, family, and community life are interwoven with this economic structure in myriad ways which have also differentiated the situations of white and black women. Many more women and men will contend with similar situations, which will make cross-gender and race alliances on issues of basic life support (with or without jobs) necessary, not just mice.\r\n\r\nThe new technologies also have a profound effect on hunger and on food production for subsistence world-wide. Rae Lessor Blumberg (1983) estimates that women produce about 50 per cent of the world's subsistence food.17 Women are excluded generally from benefiting from the increased high-tech commodification of food and energy crops, their days are made more arduous because their responsibilides to provide food do not diminish, and their reproductive situations are made more complex. Green Revolution technologies interact with other high-tech industrial production to alter gender divisions of labour and differential gender migration patterns.\r\nThe new technologies seem deeply involved in the forms of'privatization' that Ros Petchesky (1981) has analysed, in which militarization, right-wing family ideologies and policies, and intensified definitions of corporate (and state) property as private synergistically interact.18 The new communications technologies are fundamental to the eradication of 'public life' for everyone. This facilitates the mushrooming of a permanent high-tech military establishment at the cultural and economic expense of most people, but especially of women. Technologies like video games and highly miniaturized televi-sions seem crucial to production of modern forms of 'private life'. The culture of video games is heavily orientated to individual compedtion and extraterrestrial warfare. High-tech, gendered imaginations are produced here, imaginations that can contemplate destruction of the planet and a sci-fi escape from its consequences. More than our imaginations is militarized; and the other realities of electronic and nuclear warfare are inescapable. These are the technologies that promise ultimate mobility and perfect exchange \u2014 and incidentally enable tourism, that perfect practice of mobility and exchange, to emerge as one of the world's largest single industries.\r\n\r\nThe new technologies affect the social relations of both sexuality and of reproduction, and not always in the same ways. The close ties of sexuality and instrumentality, of views of the body as a kind of private satisfaction- and utility-maximizing machine, are described nicely in sociobiological origin stories that stress a genetic calculus and explain the inevitable dialectic of domination of male and female gender roles.19 These sociobiological stories depend on a high-tech view of the body as a biotic component or cybernetic communications system. Among the many transformations of reproductive situations is the medical one, where women's bodies have boundaries newly permeable to both 'visualization' and 'intervention'. Of course, who controls the interpretation of bodily boundaries in medical hermeneubcs is a major feminist issue. The speculum served as an icon of women's claiming their bodies in the 1970S; that handcraft tool is inadequate to express our needed body politics in the negotiation of reality in the practices of cyborg reproduction. Self-help is not enough. The technologies of visualization recall the important cultural practice of hundng with the camera and the deeply predatory nature of a photographic consciousness.20 Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are central actors in high-tech myth systems structuring our imaginations of personal and social possibility.\r\nAnother critical aspect of the social relations of the new technologies is the reformulation of expectations, culture, work, and reproduction for the large scientific and technical work-force. A major social and political danger is the formation of a strongly bimodal social structure, with the masses of women and men of all ethnic groups, but especially people of colour, confined to a homework economy, illiteracy of several varieties, and general redundancy and impotence, controlled by high-tech repressive apparatuses ranging from entertainment to surveillance and disappearance. An adequate socialist-feminist politics should address women in the privileged occupational categories, and particularly in the production of science and technology that constructs scientific-technical discourses, processes, and objects.21\r\n\r\nThis issue is only one aspect of enquiry into the possibility of a feminist science, but it is important. What kind of constitutive role in the production of knowledge, imagination, and practice can new groups doing science have? How can these groups be allied with progressive social and political movements? What kind of political accountability can be constructed to the women together across the scientific-technical hierarchies separating us? Might there be ways of developing feminist science/technology politics in alliance with and-military science facility conversion action groups? Many sciendfic and technical workers in Silicon Valley, the high-tech cowboys included, do not want to work on military science.22 Can these personal preferences and cultural tendencies be welded into progressive politics among this professional middle class in which women, including women of colour, are coming to be fairly numerous?\r\n\r\nWomen in the integrated circuit\r\nLet me summarize the picture of women's historical locations in advanced industrial societies, as these positions have been restructured partly through the social relations of science and technology. If it was ever possible ideologically to characterize women's lives by the disdnction of public and private domains \u2014 suggested by images of the division of working-class life into factory and home, of bourgeois life into market and home, and of gender existence into personal and political realms \u2014 it is now a totally misleading ideology, even to show how both terms of these dichotomies construct each other in practice and in theory. I prefer a network ideological image, suggesting the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic. 'Networking' is both a feminist practice and a multinational corporate strategy \u2014 weaving is for oppositional cyborgs.\r\n\r\nSo let me return to the earlier image of the informatics of domination and trace one vision of women's 'place' in the integrated circuit, touching only a few idealized social locations seen primarily from the point of view of advanced capitalist societies: Home, Market, Paid Work Place, State, School, Clinic-Hospital, and Church. Each of these idealized spaces is logically and practically implied in every other locus, perhaps analogous to a holographic photograph. I want to suggest the impact of the social relations mediated and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis and practical work. However, there is no 'place' for women in these networks, only geometries of difference and contradiction crucial to women's cyborg identities. If we learn how to read these webs of power and social life, we might learn new couplings, new coalitions. There is no way to read the following list from a standpoint of'idendfication', of a unitary self. The issue is dispersion. The task is to survive in the diaspora.\r\nHome: Women-headed households, serial monogamy, flight of men, old women alone, technology of domestic work, paid homework, re-emergence of home sweat-shops, home-based businesses and telecom-muting, electronic cottage, urban homelessness, migration, module architecture, reinforced (simulated) nuclear family, intense domestic violence.\r\nMarket: Women's continuing consumption work, newly targeted to buy the profusion of new production from the new technologies (especially as the competitive race among industrialized and industrializing nations to avoid dangerous mass unemployment necessitates finding ever bigger new markets for ever less clearly needed commodities); bimodal buying power, coupled with advertising targeting of the numerous affluent groups and neglect of the previous mass markets; growing importance of informal markets in labour and commodities parallel to high-tech, affluent market structures; surveillance systems through electronic funds transfer; intensified market abstraction (commodification) of experience, resulting in ineffective utopian or equivalent cynical theories of community; extreme mobility (abstraction) of marketing/financing systems; inter-penetration of sexual and labour markets; intensified sexualization of abstracted and alienated consumption.\r\n\r\nPaid Work Place: Continued intense sexual and racial division of labour, but considerable growth of membership in privileged occupational categories for many white women and people of colour; impact of new technologies on women's work in clerical, service, manufacturing (especially textiles), agriculture, electronics; international restructuring of the working classes; development of new time arrangements to facilitate the homework economy (flex time, part time, over time, no time); homework and out work; increased pressures for two-tiered wage structures; significant numbers of people in cash-dependent populations world-wide with no experience or no further hope of stable employment; most labour 'marginal' or 'feminized'.\r\nState: Continued erosion of the welfare state; decentralizations with increased surveillance and control; citizenship by telematics; imperialism and political power broadly in the form of information rich/information poor differentiation; increased high-tech militarization increasingly opposed by many social groups; reduction of civil service jobs as a result of the growing capital intensification of office work, with implications for occupational mobility for women of colour; growing privadzation of material and ideological life and culture; close integration of privatization and militarization, the high-tech forms of bourgeois capitalist personal and public life; invisibility of different social groups to each other, linked to psychological mechanisms of belief in abstract enemies.\r\n\r\nSchool: Deepening coupling of high-tech capital needs and public educa-tion at all levels, differentiated by race, class, and gender; managerial classes involved in educational reform and refunding at the cost of remaining progressive educational democratic structures for children and teachers; education for mass ignorance and repression in technocratic and militarized culture; growing and-science mystery cults in dissendng and radical political movements; continued relative scientific illiteracy among white women and people of colour; growing industrial direction of education (especially higher education) by science-based multinationals (particularly in electronics- and biotechnology-dependent companies); highly educated, numerous elites in a progressively bimodal society.\r\n\r\nClinic-hospital: Intensified machine-body relations; renegotiations of public metaphors which channel personal experience of the body, particularly in relation to reproduction, immune system functions, and 'stress' phenomena; intensification of reproductive politics in response to world historical implications of women's unrealized, potential control of their relation to reproduction; emergence of new, historically specific diseases; struggles over meanings and means of health in environments pervaded by high technology products and processes; continuing feminization of health work; intensified struggle over state responsibility for health; continued ideological role of popular health movements as a major form of American politics.\r\nChurch: Electronic fundamentalist 'super-saver' preachers solemnizing the union of electronic capital and automated fetish gods; intensified importance of churches in resisting the militarized state; central struggle over women's meanings and authority in religion; continued relevance of spirituality, intertwined with sex and health, in political struggle.\r\n\r\nThe only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a massive intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with common failure of subsistence networks for the most vulnerable. Since much of this picture interweaves with the social relations of science and technology, the urgency of a socialist-feminist politics addressed to science and technology is plain. There is much now being tione, and the grounds for political work are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms of collecdve struggle for women in paid work, like SEIU's District 925,* should be a high priority for all of us. These efforts are profoundly deaf to technical restructuring of labour processes and reformations of working classes. These efforts also are providing understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labour organization, involving community, sexuality, and family issues never privileged in the largely white male industrial unions.\r\n\r\nThe structural rearrangements related to the social relations of science and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not necessary to be uldmately depressed by the implications of late twentieth-century women's relation to all aspects of work, culture, production of knowledge, sexuality, and reproduction. For excellent reasons, most Marxisms see domination best and have trouble understanding what can only look like false consciousness and people's complicity in their own domination in late capitalism. It is crucial to remember that what is lost, perhaps especially from women's points of view, is often virulent forms of oppression, nostalgically naturalized in the face of current violation. Ambivalence towards the disrupted unides mediated by high-tech culture requires not sorting consciousness into categories of clear-sighted critique grounding a solid political epistemology *Service Employees International Union's office workers' organization in the US. versus 'manipulated false consciousness', but subtle understanding of emerging pleasures, experiences, and powers with serious potential for changing the rules of the game.\r\n\r\nThere are grounds for hope in the emerging bases for new kinds of unity across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units of socialist-feminist analysis themselves suffer protean transformations. Intensifications of hardship experienced world-wide in connection with the social relations of science and technology are severe. But what people are experiencing is not transparently clear, and we lack aufficiently subtle connections for collectively building effective theories of experience. Present efforts \u2014 Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, anthropological \u2014 to clarify even 'our' experience are rudimentary.\r\n\r\nI am conscious of the odd perspecdve provided by my historical position \u2014 a PhD in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik's impact on US national science-education policy. I have a body and mind as much constructed by the post-Second World War arms race and cold war as by the women's movements. There are more grounds for hope in focusing on the contradictory effects of politics designed to produce loyal American technocrats, which also produced large numbers of dissidents, than in focusing on the present defeats.\r\n\r\nThe permanent pardality of feminist points of view has consequences for our expectations of forms of political organization and participation. We do not need a totality in order to work well. The feminist dream of a common language, like all dreams for a perfectly true language, of perfectly faithful naming of experience, is a totalizing and imperialist one. In that sense, dialectics too is a dream language, longing to resolve contradiction. Perhaps, ironically, we can learn from our fusions with animals and machines how not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos. From the point of view of pleasure in these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science.\r\n\r\nCyborgs: a myth of political identity\r\nI want to conclude with a myth about idendty and boundaries which might inform late twentieth-century political imaginations (Plate 1). I am indebted in this story to writers like Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, John Varley, James Tiptree, Jr, Octavia Butler, Monique Wittig, and Vonda McIntyre.23 These are our story-tellers exploring what it means to be embodied in high-tech worlds. They are theorists for cyborgs. Exploring concephons of bodily boundaries and social order, the anthropologist Mary Douglas (1966, 1970) should be credited with helping us to consciousness about how fundamental body imagery is to world view, and so to political language.\r\n\r\nFrench feminists like Luce Irigaray and Monique Wittig, for all their differences, know how to write the body; how to weave eroticism, cosmology, and politics from imagery of embodiment, and especially for Wittig, from imagery of fragmentation and reconstitution of bodies.24\r\nAmerican radical feminists like Susan Griffnn, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich have profoundly affected our political imaginations \u2014 and perhaps restricted too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language.25 They insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological. But their symbolic systems and the related positions of ecofeminism and feminist paganism, replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval's terms as oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of late capitalism. In that sense they are part of the cyborg world. But there are also great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the possibilides inherent in the breakdown of clean disdnctions between organism and machine and similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity of breakdowns that cracks the matrices of domination and opens geometric possibilities. What might be learned from personal and political 'technological' pollution? I look briefly at two overlapping groups of texts for their insight into the construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions of women of colour and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction.\r\n\r\nEarlier I suggested that 'women of colour' might be understood as a cyborg idendty, a potent subjecdvity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities and in the complex political-historical layerings of her 'biomythography', Zami (Lorde, 1982; King, 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural grids mapping this potential, Audre Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the title of her Sister Outsider. In my political myth, Sister Outsider is the offshore woman, whom US workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard as the enemy prevendug their solidarity, threatening their security. Onshore, inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider is a potential amidst the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated for division, competition, and exploitation in the same industries. 'Women of colour' are the preferred labour force for the science-based industries, the real women for whom the world-wide sexual market, labour market, and politics of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in the sex industry and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools, educated for the integrated circuit. Literacy, especially in English, distinguishes the 'cheap' female labour so attractive to the multinationals.\r\n\r\nContrary to orientalist stereotypes of the 'oral primidve', literacy is a special mark of women of colour, acquired by US black women as well as men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading and wridng. Writing has a special significance for all colonized groups. Writing has been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between oral and written cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more recently to the erosion of that distinction in 'postmodernist' theories attacking the phallogo-centrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic, phallic, authoritative, and singular work, the unique and perfect name.26 Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political struggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and stories of US women of colour are repeatedly about writing, about access to the power to signify; but this dme that power must be neither phallic nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other.\r\nThe tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling origin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing for fulfilment in apocalypse. The phallogocentrie origin stories most crucial for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies \u2014 teehnologies that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics \u2014 that have recently textualized our bodies as code problems on the grid of C3I. Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.\r\n\r\nFiguratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of women of colour; and stories about language have a special power in the rich contemporary writing by US women of colour. For example, retellings of the stom~ of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mesdzo 'bastard' race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry special meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherrie Moraga (1983) in Loving in the War Years explores the themes of identity when one never possessed the original language, never told the original story, never resided in the harmony of legitimate heterosexuality in the garden of culture, and so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to natural names, mother's or father's.27 Moraga's writing, her superb literacy, is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche's mastery of the conqueror's language \u2014 a violation, an illegitimate production, that allows survival. Moraga's language is not 'whole'; it is self-consciously spliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conqueror's languages. But it is this chimeric monster, without claim to an original language before violation, that crafts the erode, competent, potent identities of women of colour. Sister Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not because of her innocence, but because of her ability to live on the boundaries, to write without the founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to be the innocent and all-powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral of appropriation by her son. Writing marks Moraga's body, affirms it as the body of a woman of colour, against the possibility of passing into the unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of 'original illiteracy' of a mother that never was. Malinche was mother here, not Eve before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not the Woman-before-the-Fall-into-Writing needed by the phallogocentric Family of Man.\r\n\r\nWriting is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism. That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollution, rejoicing in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings which make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire, the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of reproduction of 'Western' idendty, of nature and culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. 'We' did not originally choose to be cyborgs, but choice grounds a liberal politics and epistemology that imagines the reproduction of individuals before the wider replications of 'texts'.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground politics in 'our' privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent position of moral superiority, innocence, and greater closeness to nature. With no available original dream of a common language or original symbiosis promising protection from hostile 'masculine' separation, but written into the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history, to recognize 'oneself' as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the need to root politics in identification, vanguard parties, purity, and mothering. Stripped of identity, the bastard race teaches about the power of the margins and the importance of a mother like Malinche. Women of colour have transformed her from the evil mother of masculinist fear into the originally literate mother who teaches survival.\r\n\r\nThis is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation. Every, story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation; that is, war, tempered by imaginary respite in the bosom of the Other. These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics \u2014 rebirth without flaw, perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selflhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginaw. It passes through women and other present-tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not of Woman born, who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so as to have a real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear on cue, no matter how many dmes a 'western' commentator remarks on the sad passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by 'Western' technology, by writing.28 These real-life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast Asian village women workers inJapanese and US electronics firms described by Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and sociedes. Sumival is the stakes in this play of readings.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of colour, nature, workers, animals \u2014 in short, domination of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/ made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, totaVpartial, God/man. The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the semice of the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many.\r\n\r\nHigh-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine. It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that resolve into coding practices. In so far as we know ourselves in both formal discourse (for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids, mosaics, chimeras. Biological organisms have become biotic systems, communications devices like others. There is no fundamental, ontological separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical and organic. The replicant Rachel in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner stands as the image of a cyborg culture's fear, love, and confusion.\r\n\r\nOne consequence is that our sense of connection to our tools is heightened. The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple of science-fiction film and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization with other communication devices.29 Anne McCaffrey's pre-feminist The Ship Who Sang (1969) explored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl's brain and complex machinery, formed after the birth of a severely handicapped child. Gender, sexuality, embodiment, skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the seventeenth century dll now, machines could be animated \u2014 given ghostly souls to make them speak or move or to account for their orderly development and mental capacides. Or organisms could be mechan-ized \u2014 reduced to body understood as resource of mind. These machine/ organism relationships are obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly selves. We don't need organic holism to give impermeable whole-ness, the total woman and her feminist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts, feminist science fiction.\r\n\r\nThe cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problematic the statuses of man or woman, human, artefact, member of a race, individual endty, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions is not largely based on idendfication. Students facingJoanna Russ for the first time, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of The Adventures of Alyx or The Female Man, where characters refuse the reader's search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests, exuberant eroticism, and serious politics. The Female Man is the story of four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together do not make a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove the growing scandal of gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel R. Delany, especially Tales of Neveyon, mocks stories of origin by redoing the neolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization to subvert their plausibility. James Tiptree, Jr, an author whose fiction was regarded as particularly manly undl her 'true' gender was revealed, tells tales of reproduction based on non-mammalian technologies like alternation of generations of male brood pouches and male nurturing. John Varley constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch-feminist exploration of Gaea, a mad goddess-planet-trickster-old woman-technological device on whose surface an extraordinary array of post-cyborg symbioses are spawned. Octavia Butler writes of an African sorceress pithug her powers of transformation against the genetic manipulations of her rival (Wild Seed), of dme warps that bring a modern US black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her white master-ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth (Kindred), and of the illegidmate insights into idendty and community of an adopted cross-species child who came to know the enem' as self (Survivor). In Dawn (1987), the first instalment of a series called Xenogenesis, Butler tells the story of Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam's first and repudiated wife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the son of Nigerian immigrants to the US. A black woman and a mother whose child is dead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic exchange with extra-terrestrial lovers/rescuers/destroyers/genetic engineers, who reform earth's habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce surviving humans into intimate fusion with them. It is a novel that interrogates reproductive, linguishc, and nuclear politics in a mythic field structured by late twentieth-century race and gender.\r\n\r\nBecause it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda McIn-tyre's Superluminal can close this truncated catalogue of promising and dangerous monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is 'simply' human, human status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus vectors carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. Lacnea becomes a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing survival in transit at speeds exceeding that of light. Radu Dracul survives a virus-caused plague in his outerworld planet to find himself with a time sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species. All the characters explore the limits of language; the dream of communicating experience; and the necessity of limitation, partiality, and indmacy even in this world of protean transformation and connection. Superluminal stands also for the defining contradictions of a cyborg world in another sense; it embodies textually the intersection of feminist theory and colonial discourse in the science fiction I have alluded to in this chapter. This is a conjunction with a long history that many 'First World' feminists have tried to repress, including myself in my readings of Superluminal before being called to account by Zoe Sofoulis, whose different location in the world system's informatics of domin-ation made her acutely alert to the imperialist moment of all science fiction cultures, including women's science fiction. From an Australian feminist sensitivity, Sofoulis remembered more readily McIntyre's role as writer of the adventures of Captain Kirk and Spock in TV's Star Trek series than her rewriting the romance in Superluminal.\r\n\r\nMonsters have always defined the limits of community in Western imaginations. The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the centred polls of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman. Unseparated twins and hermaphrodites were the confused human material in early modern France who grounded discourse on the natural and supernatural, medical and legal, portents and diseases \u2014 all crucial to establishing modern identity.30 The evolutionary and behavioural sciences of monkeys and apes have marked the multiple boundaries of late twentieth-century industrial identities. Cyborg monsters in feminist science fiction define quite different political possibilities and limits from those proposed by the mundane fiction of Man and Woman.\r\n\r\nThere are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs as other than our enemies. Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are maps of power and identity. Cyborgs are no exception. A cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment. The machine is not an it to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they. Up till now (once upon a time), female embodiment seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric exten-sions. Only by being out of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females. Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth.\r\n\r\nThe ideologically charged question of what counts as daily activity, as experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image. Feminists have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemo-logical position potentially. There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that makes visible unvalued female activity and names it as the ground of life. But the ground of life? What about all the ignorance of women, all the exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men's access to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart, to play? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility taking a global vengeance. Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory, but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and deconstruction. There is a myth system waiting to become a political language to ground one way of looking at science and technology and challenging the informatics of domination \u2014 in order to act potently.\r\n\r\nOne last image organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For salamanders, regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury. The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been injured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender.\r\n\r\nCyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second, taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology, and so means embracing the skilful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits of the supersavers of the new right. It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.\r\n\r\n1 The US equivalent of Mills & Boon.\r\n\r\n2 A practice at once both spiritual and political that linked guards and arrested anti-nuclear demonstrators in the Alameda County jail in California in the early 1985.\r\n", "html_text": "<p>the arthackday</p>", "realtime_ended": "2013-04-13T18:00:00Z", "publish_at": "2013-10-11T18:51:38Z", "credits": null, "active": true, "slug": "arthackday"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"datetime_modified": "2013-10-24T18:32:51.554Z", "title": "The art of exploitation", "process": "Completed", "type": "Workshops", "image": "media/dsc_1081.jpg", "author": 1, "excerpt": "the art of exploitation", "realtime_started": "2012-08-28T16:00:00Z", "datetime_created": "2013-10-11T19:34:46.879Z", "blog": 1, "the_text": "Hacking the Art of exploitation a workshop report\r\n- learning from Sparvn\u00e4stet, Open Tech School and tech Meetups;\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 2012 Sparvn\u00e4stet was filled with workshops in Arduino and network and computer security. In this short report I will start to look at the learning model of our network and computer security workshops as a way to understand the concept of openness. The reflection is done in conjunction with tech Meetups and Open Tech School workshops that I also visited and engaged in during the period.\r\n\r\nSparvn\u00e4stet\r\nThe weekly workshops at Hemliga Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden were open to anyone and announced on the website (www.sparvnastet.org). We provided directions on how to prepare: what books to read, what online documentation to follow, and what software to install. We made all the resources required for each workshop available online. Nothing more than a laptop (preferable with Linux) was needed to join the exploration.\r\n\r\n4ZM facilitated the workshops while participants shared their experience. On the first meeting in late August we started to explored different patterns of exploitation with passive information gathering techniques and non-intrusive network reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nDivided into small groups the goal was to collect target data and map a random organization on Internet. As a tool (and proxy) we used serversniff.net. We shared an online collaborative pad, to collect information of possible vectors.\r\n\r\nFollowing the effect of \u201cmake all\u201d the first workshop sessions on computer security were a big success; the turnout was huge and the room packed.\r\n\r\nThe simple learning environment worked significantly well. A laptop and the internet, with all tools and resources already available, make a great starting point for the exploration. The open free self-organization learning and exploration workshop is easy to join, or if you are more skilled it seems easy to become a resource for others. With the right guidance from the facilitator the group explore together. When one task was exhausted, an idea of what to explore next was formed in the group or presented by the facilitator. The quest becomes dynamic; joint targets and tasks form between the facilitator and the group of individuals as the exploration moves forward. \r\n\r\nThe format is a collaborative lab of tasks. It is based on learning by doing and in its basic form a brilliant way to learn. This model is an example of the kind of free shared knowledge space that I look for, also including a long term commitment.\r\n\r\nThe following weeks follow the same pattern but with a decreasing of number of participants as the semi-outdoor space gets too cold as time passes from late summer to cold autumn nights.\r\n\r\nDuring these weeks the network reconnaissance become more active for instance we learn and utilize specific tools like Nmap to get a fuller picture of the target networked machine. As we turned to the exploit suit, Metasploit we provided our own virtual vulnerable machines as target to hack into. We learned how to find vulnerabilities, utilize buffer overflows and insert shellcode to be executed on the target machine. When the shellcode was successfully inserted it was possible to gain control over programs and the system and, for instance, start a root shell. To one of the last workshops 4ZM had started to write a fuzzing tool to cause memory corruption.\r\n\r\nIt was dark and cold and only a core group joined the last workshop on the Aircrack suite. Meanwhile we had decided to move temporarily to The Royal Institute of Art where new workshops on new themes would take place.\r\n\r\nDuring the period and as part of my research I attended several workshops of similar but still different character as the ones Sparvn\u00e4stet organized. The reason was to try to understand similar formats, to have something to compare with and to further understand the format of open self-organized learning environments and shared knowledge spaces. It was so called Meetups around open source software and workshops organized by Open Tech School.\r\n\r\nTech Meetups\r\nI attended software developer meetups in open source programing languages like Python, the Python Web framework Django and Javascript.\r\n\r\nAs stated on meetup.com, \u201cMeetups are neighbors getting together to learn something, do something, share something.\u201d Meetup.com \u201cHelps groups of people with shared interests plan events and facilitates off line group meetings in various localities around the world.\u201d Anyone can organize a meetup on a chosen topic by creating the event at meetup.com and invite people. Tech meetups are events where a community around certain programs, frameworks and interest can come together and share their experience.\r\n\r\nTech meetups serves as a way for the developer to network and to stay in touch with the latest development trends and framework changes. The interest in these free meetups is therefore big and to get a spot you have to RSVP as soon as the meetup is announced at the meetup page.\r\n\r\nAt the Meetup usually either presentations or workshops in conjunction with these are made. Software Companies that has an interest to promote certain tools and frameworks happily lend their offices at off hours to these events. The companies additionally provide food and drinks, including alcohol, for free in a more or less fancy fashion to promote their own brand to the target community.\r\n\r\nIn regards to openness, access and the new competitive business environment internet has created two meetups that I visited at Spotify was of special interest. Spotify signifies a business  \u201csolution\u201d and success story.\r\n\r\nThe most fancy and status enhancing was a meetup on Javascript. It was attended by more than 200 people and had a luxurious buffet. I can see how vital it is for the community of developers as a manifestation of their networks and culture but at a same time it is clearly a spectacle. The format only consisted of a couple of presentations but the feeling of being part of a success culture was strongly emphasized by the Spotify environment.\r\n\r\nAt another Spotify occasion, a Meetup in python, I was intrigued by how the person presented Spotify and why they wanted to host a Meetup in Python. He stated that Spotify likes open source and python is a great backend language. Then he continued to talk about their success story. He described it as an endeavor to solve the piracy problem and to recreate a working relation between consumers, artists and the industry. Spotify creates new enclosure on the open principals of internet, open source software and with already available content.\r\n\r\nThe meetups had a clear backdrop of enhancing the mainstream economy. When placing such open source events at Spotify it is clear that the organizers see Spotify as great. Even if these meetups are free, open and promote flow of ideas the final aim running under these open systems seem to gravitate towards a private gain.  \r\n\r\nSpotify could be an example how openness can work against a more general access. What is the role that openness plays here? Is this an openness to make enclosure work? The same goes for many other big companies like Facebook and Google where openness works as a key to their success that create different forms of enclosure.  \r\n\r\nIn terms of knowledge space this meetup format was linear and straightforward. They were very large and consisted of presentations and had no workshops. In this they didn\u2019t offer much else when what was announced and felt predictable. In comparison the Meetup on the Python based web framework Django was smaller in size and made room for peer considerations.\r\n\r\nThe format chosen was a kind of peer based learning, the so called Open Space Technology. In Open Space Technology (OST) the focus is on a specific purpose that limits the span and hopefully creates a specialized and interested crowd. From an overall agenda discussion groups with special interests are formed.\r\n\r\nAt this meetup, after introduction and one presentation, people in the group came up with a list of topics of interest. Then individuals voted on topics. The top most once crystallized and different groups formed around these. The groups when relocated to different spaces where discussions continued on the specific topics. It worked well and discussions were initiated. I joined a group on Django and Security, later I listened in on Django and test driven development.\r\n\r\nAs a way to learn I would consider this format rather radical since it\u2019s based on trust of peer engagement and leaves room for change depending on the constellation and interest in the group.\r\n\r\nThe process of dividing the bigger group in smaller workshop peer groups is one strategy to create a better learning environment. A meetup can take any format and the format can be explored. Since developer culture is fairly new there is a big interest to find ways to network collaborate and continually learn.\r\n\r\nOpen Tech School\r\nThe OpenTechSchool (OTS) was founded in Berlin and one of the more active members visited Stockholm during this period. I join several of their workshops, one in python and also one on git where I helped out as a teacher.\r\n\r\nThe OpenTechSchool has a more manifest learning agenda and format to for learning. As they say on their homepage:\r\n\r\nOpenTechSchool is a community initiative offering free programming workshops and meetups to technology enthusiasts of all genders, backgrounds, and experience levels. It supports volunteer coaches in setting up events by taking care of the organizational details, encouraging coaches to create original teaching material. This material is then openly shared online and can be further developed by contributions from the global OTS community. OTS\u2019 main goal is to create a friendly learning environment where no one feels shy about asking any question. Everyone is invited to participate...\r\n\r\nOpenTechSchool are based on openness, sharing, self-organization and non-profit principles, learning by doing and empowerment and smaller groups creating a safe learning environment. With teachers intensive workshops and good online material to follow, the workshops that I visited succeeded to create a good and an intimate learning environment.\r\n\r\nCompared with the meetups the focus was not only on developer but learners, on people that wanted to learn development. Compared with Sparvn\u00e4stet OpenTechSchool had a more diverse crowd which is something I find to be of essential value when looking for a more general model of diversity and participation. The overrepresentation of ( young ) men represents a democratic problem.\r\n\r\nThe values and principles are not unique for OpenTechSchool but are values that are recognized by developer and the hacker community at large. Sparvn\u00e4stet also share these values and what we do is similar.\r\n\r\nIt is great what they do but when looking at their website from a hacker perspective it puzzles me that they use PayPal even though I can understand the convenience. It reveals that they are not sensitive to engage with mega players stopping the payment to Wikileaks as one could expect a hacker community to be.\r\n\r\nEven though I acknowledged the inclusive learning model I find a possible problem in how they consolidate and brand an open idea of learning. Branding makes the format clear and provides a format where the rules of engagement are clear. The format can be copied and remade in any city around the world but in the process they also start to build the OpenTechSchool brand. OpenTechSchool become an institution that might have means and ends that are different from their core values.\r\n\r\n\r\nComments and Issues\r\nInternet and common open protocols has enabled a path for the urge to organize and attend such open learning endeavors described here. Since developer and hacker culture are fairly new and on the move there is a big interest to find ways to network, collaborate and continually learn.\r\n\r\nBut how the idea of openness is used can be very ambiguous and must be seen in relation to the larger flow of freedom in society. These forms of open meetings take essentially different forms around internet enabled local communities who want to network and learn. At these meetings I experienced different learning agencies, as a hacker, developer, peer and learner.\r\n\r\nOne possible way to understand openness in this circumstance is to think about what kind of freedoms it produces and what kind of freedoms surrounds it. To name some:\r\n\r\nDoes free means free to enter\r\nDoes free mean gratis, as in free beer\r\nDoes it mean that the meetings are done without attachment to other institution or companies and are self-organized and strive for independence\r\nDoes it mean that is inclusive and creates diversity? Is it free as in access? For instance how much previous knowledge and subculture lingo are required to enter the workshop freely\r\nDoes free mean that the agenda is open and give room for unpredictability?\r\n\r\nAnother question could be whether there can be conflicts between horizontal and vertical freedoms. Might there be a contradiction between vertical moment of specialization / skills and horizontal movement of diversity. If so are some forms of organization or even lack of control of learning better at handle such contradictions?\r\n\r\nDoes peer collaboration and planned or institutionalized learning handle freedom differently? Is learning, art or hacking done differently under these peer conditions and hierarchical planned circumstances. Maybe peer collaboration and coordination without institutionalization is the answer to solve thresholds between skill and diversity and create a kind of continuous space of possibilities. What can I do to further explore this tension?\r\n\r\nIn my research openness, self-organization and the commons are not only means but an end. With these learning models it is sometimes hard to know if the value produced can be recapture by privatizing interests and drain the common. How can the common that we make, escape the captured by privatizing powers?\r\n\r\nCan things be open without require communality and under what circumstances is the communality just a means to another end? Look at the example of Facebook, Google and Spotify and how they utilize openness to enter and build enclosing and proprietary models that are hard to exit.\r\n\r\nCommercial institutionalization can be a way to whitewash and clean the hacker agency from unpredictable behaviors and set rules for \u201cproductive\u201d hacking. As an example one can look at how companies organized hackathons and how the force of hacking are remade into a tool to enable commercial integration. At numerous hackathons organise by these companies tech students are invited to \u201chack\u201d; to explore the companies open API. The company might be able to get some free labor but more troubling is the way the format frame hacking as a commercial and private force. When I'm looking for a creative force it is not the capture of this kind of free labor I'm looking for but something that can create more unpredictable peer value outside private capture.   \r\n\r\nA key to hide from a recapturing logic could be to stay away from consolidation and institutionalization. Maybe peer coordination can escape at least the direct capture and still be a way to organize learning and production models.    \r\n\r\nHow to deal with unpredictability is essential. Looking at our website program of \u201chacking the art of exploitation\u201d it might look suspicious and some people might even find it bit scary. And in some way it is, because the nature of hacking is unpredictable. An exploration must be unpredictable. The darkness here is to enter an unknown territory.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to defend hacking or art in itself other than making it a question of personal endeavor, moral and into a special kind of unknown and unpredictability. In a free society, regarding also art or media skills, it is not about the possibility or knowledge to make stuff or things happen but how the knowledge is materialized or put into motion. Learning hacking starts both a quest of knowledge and skill but also an ethical path. Self-organizations require personal ethics and skills to handle unpredictability. \r\n\r\nIn peer based learning institutional ethics or laws can be replaced with peer coordination where the morals and skills are actively developed by the individual in the group. The behavior of the group is not a question of central authority and therefore will remain more unpredictable.\r\n\r\nHow you choose to use what you learn is up to each individual; a coordination without institutional guidelines. That also means that ethics must be developed and iterated.\r\n\r\nOne way to defend why we should learn how to hack is to use it as a defense. Knowing how to hack into computers also allow you to understand and prevent attacks. Activities that might be in a grey zone of what is legal are not conducted at our open meetings or at least not part of a manifest agenda. But things that we learned in the workshop could be used as ground for new hacking. For instance some port scanning projects might have been conducted. But my research will not follow any such specific paths.\r\n\r\nAdditionally and more importantly making these explorations also meant learning network communication, how internet actually work, how packets are sent, machine architecture, how computers handles memory and how data are stored.\r\n\r\nFinding out how the world works should be free.\r\n\r\nThe hacker attitude is a general creative attitude to approach the world and in some ways with a clearer agency in compared with art. Are hackers the new avant-garde or is a technological literacy something that is for everyone. \r\n\r\nWe are networked as hackers, net activists, net artistes and citizens. Are these abstract and actual protocols surrounding just something that runs the machinery that we interact with or is the exploration of the workings of the machine also essential to understand the world. If digital media are becoming more common so should all artist learn these hacking? Are this leading to a digital humanities where artist become tech learners and if so can these endeavors ever be institutionalized?\r\n\r\nUnpredictability of hacking (like art) and institutional anxiety will be a theme to follow when we move the hackerspace The Royal Institute of Art.\r\nIssues\r\nThe technical aspect of building a model, what technical exploration can lead to, as a way to understand aspects of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:\\palle\\bilder\\2012-07 20120918_194215\r\nhttp://www.opentechschool.org/about.html#core_values\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_technology\r\nhttp://blog.opentechschool.org/2012/10/wrapping-up-jsfab-stockholm.html\r\nhttp://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/02/thinking-education-further-than-tech.html\r\n\r\nCoordination vs. planning collaboration vs. institution\r\nTaking an existing format, trying to create a new one or just coordinate what is already there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with art the artist has to make a kind of risk analysis since the work is somewhat private and therefore the conveying of the message is based on interpretation.

PRACTICAL IMAGINATION   \r\n\r\nAs part of the piracy and hacker communities, we have seen a lot of creative processes and transgressive strategies and tactics that could be part of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis has led to some questions;  What can piracy teach, that the higher education cannot? What if the higher education embraced piracy? As piracy rearranges the reality around us; What possibilities and desires for a greater commons and learning could that open up?\r\n\r\nAs an introduction we have a short science fiction text about the reorganization of society and how something that could by call cybernetic anarchy pirate communes are forming around open knowledge processes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nScience fiction is a short cut to imagination. By asking \u201cWhat if...\u201d we can start to explore the implication of relation between culture, society and technology in an accessible way. I think piracy works in a mirrored way, by a kind of a  \u201cWhat if...\u201d hands on doing. What if we do like this. What if I do like that. The pirate start to  reassemble the world around her making access to culture, society and technology possible. In this way we can call piracy a type of practical imagination. \r\n\r\n\r\nPiracy is a knowledge and transformative process as is rearranges the reality around us and explores the relation between culture, society and technology in a way where access is a key. In practice by testing, transgress, probing to find out what is possible opening fractions, open up fractals, mixing, leaving the world as it was found in an unfinished flux. Thus piracy has no final solution but is a constantly evolving struggle. \r\n\r\nThis type of piracy is a kind of basic resistance because it is altering the basic organizing principles of society and how we function. Logically it can be used as a weapon against the current systems of domination of state and capital. \r\n\r\n1 / 10 PP aka .. . / PIRACY; the user and the system.  \r\n\r\nToday two weeks ago Aaron Swartz committed suicide. What can Aaron Swartz's death teach us about the contemporary higher educational systems as a distributor and controller of knowledge? How does the relation between the user and the system play out in this case?\r\n\r\nThe user, the individual, a person, Aaron Swartz, a american programmer, hacker, organizer and activist. He was a Pirate and he highly valued access to information and knowledge. That is why he downloaded Millions Jstor academic MIT pdfs with the intent to share them.\r\n\r\nThe system, MIT and a the MIT network including Jstor. MIT is an institution that has a long tradition of a special kind of freedom. MIT was one of the places where the first generation of hacker gathered and spawned. It was where Richard Stallman came up with the concept of free software, trying to liberate the user from preparatory software systems. MIT also has long tradition of openness and making higher education more accessible, like the free online course of Opencourseware.  \r\n\r\nAs we can read in the Aarons family's official statement we need to take part in forming the future of education in a tradition of freedom, access and openness and ...\r\n\r\n.... failing to choose sides may prove fatal to the future of both higher education and all other public services. At stake is the definition of what constitutes the political and what is subject to public debate, of what is withdrawn from scrutiny under the cloak of property rights or the laws of economy.\r\n\r\nFrom Aarons family\u2019s official statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would mean that safely and steadily turn away from certain modern management and control structures and the current use of copyright as it helps in building a climate of fear as it is stressing that we need to insure the control of knowledge production. It it is neither the case that we have anything to fear from piracy and the control of it in this manner is certainly not the way forward if we are to build a sustainable higher education system of the future. A system that should be able to meet a constant global change and at the same time keep up with making an education with local relevance. \r\n\r\nThe contemporary liberal system that regulates these processes are based on the notion of individual copyrights and is causing fear, feeding domination of management that are growing obsolete with expanding networks, absolutely abstract. Real darkness disguised in vanilla, a veil over the every day. Aaron's case is an illustration of the constant miscommunication, where we are consequently dealing with a system that both what us to be in the center and step aside. This is a common contradiction of knowledge society that we need to break. \r\n\r\nHow could we trace this fear? One line of thinking we find in the thinking of the big three in greek philosophy and how they looked at knowledge. It was formulated as an existential question by Socrates. When we ask what we can know we end up at the problem of the unknown. Socrates pointed out an insecurity in knowledge that  we cannot know everything. In a political realm this insecurity makes control harder and are turned into a political fear when we ask; How can one rule the world without a solid ground? \r\n\r\nAt this point the sophist try to provide easy answers to the unsolvable questions and here by secure the contract between the citizen and the political. Or as Plato's try to answer this question with the abstract world, to insure knowledges solidity adding a hierarchical solution of knowledge but also a layer of management and leadership to understand these abstractions. We can know but knowledge need to be mediated top down, by experts, politicians and philosophers. Instantiating a level of management of insecurity, institutions of fear. \r\n\r\nHere we are defining a the citizen as a bystander, that in the everyday see the defaulting in the street. Introduce the unknown as a blackbox, a territory of the political realm, fear distant but insurance, turned into fear of the insured blackbox, representational democracy is its restless - Wow.\r\n\r\nRetaking the power is what Aristotle's pointed to, the empirical, the street, praxis, matter, the real, button up, that we can learn by looking at the world as it is. What we need is a knowledge that accepts our fear for the unknown but takes more control of the everyday away from hierarchical domination of knowledge. Let\u2019s accept that insecurity and make the unknown a guidance of a piracy imaginary. \r\n\r\n\r\n2 / 10 PP aka ... / ANARCHY from individuation to subjectivation \r\n\r\nWe live in a networked society, what we learn we could never have learned without the internet, we are from the internets and so are our fear and desires, we know how to organize, we know how to build systems, we know how to get knowledge. But can the institutions of higher education make room for a piracy imaginary?\r\n\r\nCan we help dismantle the destructive powers of top-down management, break down barriers and empower these learning processes that are flowing to a larger degree, ad hoc, outside institutional control?\r\n\r\nIf we want brilliance, the unknown and difference, if we want to facilitate the process of sometimes autodidactic and restless pirates, hackers and random users the old management style of top down planning does not cut it.\r\n\r\nIn software development this is understood. Agile methods such as scrum, with small self managed teams, are a way to give power to the developer to make development more efficient. Individual responsibility and feedback are key in these systems. This also point to a general tendency in society where we all should learn entrepreneurial skills and become self-sustained. \r\n\r\nIn hierarchical command and control structures, be it the state or big business, if resource become limited the inefficacy of the flow of information and things will break down under its own cost. One solution of this  is to push down and out the initiative and labor into the network. If they still can keep the power they have succeeded. But as they let go they will start to change the structure to a point where individuation point to a possibility to get rid of the control structure and self-organize.  \r\n\r\nThis problem of scale and power makes our current development of society full of conflicts between centralizing and decentralizing powers. Decentralisation a way to cut organisational costs means that a representative hollow management must be put in place upstreams, self-management, pushed down the chain. Suddenly working means to be part of a reports system, report society. All the power in hand by no control. \r\n\r\nSo what should be done differently? Can we fit in these systems or do we have to build our own? Is higher education becoming a middleman?  If the scope of state schools are to make us good capitalist workers, isn't that very insecure for us in a society where work is getting harder to get?  Isn't a kind of self-organized anarchy education what we need? If so,  can we abandon or withdraw from the state controlled market driven system? Can we break and bypass these organization build on estrangeing property control?\r\n\r\nIf we imagine that we could bypass the educational system, would that mean that education would become a personal endeavor and concern? Maybe not. \r\n\r\nSilvia Federici point to Negri and Hardt as they say that \u201cthe common\u201d is already evolving from the informatization and cognitivization of production.\r\n\r\n \u201cAccording to this theory, as production presumably becomes production of knowledge, culture, and subjectivity, organized through the internet, a common space and common wealth are created that escape the problem of defining rules of inclusion or exclusion. For access and use multiply the resources available on the net, rather than subtracting from them, thus signifying the possibility of a society built on abundance \u2013 the only remaining hurdle confronting the \u201cmultitude\u201d being how to prevent the capitalist \u201ccapture\u201d of the wealth produced.\u201d   \r\n\r\nNow thanks to a common forming within the current capitalist society, we can escape the dilemma of the private matter, by start adding to a commons. \r\n\r\nSo we arrive at a collaborative forms of learning and production that goes hand in hand with shared access to common resources and also the question. What models can we point to,  to guide this reorganisation. \r\n\r\n1 As an abstract model to to change the current hierarchical systems of economic and political organization/domination we can use the free and open source software development as the model for sharing. We need to continue make society into a transparent open source project. \r\n\r\n2 As a concrete model we can use decentralized network to mediate these processes: If any group of centralizing nodes produces scarcity through democratic or authoritarian means distributed networks can turn hierarchical control into networked a diversity.  But how do we keep it alive and how do we keep the infrastructure open? \r\n\r\nWhat kind of mutual aid and piracy roles are needed? Can we start to think from Richard Bartles idea of player types in game worlds as a way to map a world of the commons, a piracy as abstract territory with exteriority and internalities?

It means teaching a socially engaged empowerment. \r\n\r\nTo give way for independent and free roaming minds one might start in hacker ethics; anything that can teach you something about the way the world work should be made accessible and free. A teaching by learning, teaching by doing, hands on and in our case at the same time teaching by rebuilding and for reorganizing. The empowerment is for you and also for others, with the goal to build trust that is key for the continuation of learning. \r\n\r\nWhen we think about empowerment in this context we must extend the empowerment to build trust networks within the commons. That is we need a heads up, because within the emerging commons there will be zombies! To name some of the the ego, matter and conspiracy zombie. \r\n\r\nLook out for the ego zombie. That zombie constantly drains the commons, converting empowerment to an individual matter. Empty charades, a empty logo, a - Just do it, a pure capitalist force, for innovators without a common cause, an entrepreneurial force that just wants to make it happen. One antidote by teaching could be to empower the mind beyond the ego and to understand that ego is just a tendency and not an essence that will open up a contextualization of a commons. \r\n\r\nWhen we draw from practical based teaching like craft and art teaching, starting in matter and the personal we should also look out for the matter zombie, feeding on reductive imaginary of  \u201cfabrics and facts\u201d, superimposing images of matter as cause. This is not a playful type but feeds on conserving social relations by referring to the state of things, like of instance imposing nature on culture by say nature is natural, reversing existence to essens. One antidote by teaching could be to empower by learning to break stereotypes. \r\n\r\nWe should also add the conspiracy zombie, that make the global models an obsession in a way that the paranoia - - are swapped way from local concrete engagement. One antidote by teaching could be concrete projects.  \r\n\r\nWe should look for these zombies within our own processes. We could also talk about zombifying matter in the fabric of the everyday. Or to put it in another way, how abstractions of capital and state plays out as abstracting possible relations and the way the concrete possibilities becomes abstracted in capitalism or anti-bazaars. A consolidation, stiff an uncanny matter that can be seen in opposition how the digital and the common are converging into a plan of possibilities.  \r\n\r\n[ Or is this just Madness, play video? ] 0 - 1:00\r\n\r\nDrawing from the earlier discussion about anarchy, one could think about how we can weigh between structure and freedom of learning, weigh the collective structures and individual freedom of learners. What would a system like this look like? What would a cybernetic techno-anarchy education look like? \r\n\r\nEmpowerment needs and requires structure, self-organisation and reorganisation instead of revolution or destabilisation. Basically because the revolution is here and we just need to find a way to make it, enforce it with every demanding of equality. But how can we find the way to institutionalize equality and its regeneration without putting too much force into hands of individuals or make a structure that are more than what we gain. With what kind of math can we break the tokens of power?\r\n \r\nOnce again we will turn to a piracy imaginary and say that sharing can break the token of power.  What we need to do is to build institution with sharing where we learn to weigh sharing as structure and as force. Empowerment need to be structured in time and locally. As an example the hackerspace both transgress the tyranny of structurelessness in time and at the same time accept that self-organisation is more than us and that structurelessness are somehow needed to be successful in terms of community. By sharing our knowledge in meatspace we both start a process weighing for instance we engage in a of a unification process other but we can also be aware of the danger of consolidation of the group. In space we are able organize beyond preconceptions and recognize other people's efforts and so on. \r\n\r\nWe need to learn to weigh the insecurity together, incorporate insecurity, the is actually not other way than to make things transparent, mediated and accessible. What we are asking is how we can form a type of education but as we see in the context of cognitive capitalism we are questioning the sustainability of the current state-capital apparatus because we are inclosed in that system. \r\n\r\n4 / 10 aka ... / COGNITIVE CAPITALISM - incorporate insecurity\r\nCognitive capitalism it is the current mode of global networked production that we can not really escape. Not only software designers, students, teachers, artists, intellectuals but increasingly all. Our teaching systems are the backbone and the frontend of this systems.\r\n\r\nCognitive capitalism means that our creativeness, our ability to be creative is the basis for our work. Basically this is communication put into different forms of labour. This can be an enriching experience, but what if something so personal loses its voluntary character and become an economic necessity and a disconnected joyless construction. Still paradoxically looked in and connected at the same time. \r\n\r\nCognitive capitalism is also the landscape in which pirate teachers could evolve. To mediate, intervene and change these processes are becoming ever more pressing sense we can not escape this system.\r\n\r\nWhat if pirates have the best cognitive capitalist potential but won't serve capitalism and have a lot of surplus time and money from the capitalist system. What could we build to mediate local resistance, or help mediate people's opinions and knowledge seeking. Against top down management, how can we bypass the relation between creativity and production, property and law? Maybe by start open schools, maybe by building alternative to lock in systems, like spotify and facebook to re-insure a diversity. Rebuild the world around us, being socially engaged pirates. \r\n\r\nThere is a relation between hacking and piracy and sometime it doesn't matter what you call it. In other circumstances they could be called innovator but  the word innovator abstracts the real conflicts of information, access and equality. Hackers need access, the pirate provides it, if you are a pirate you have to learn the systems and you will become a hacker, if you are a hacker you have to become a pirate as you transgress, obstructing property laws. And it might happen that if try to stop piracy you might get hacked, if you try to stop hacking well thats not possible because it brings some much value to society and would mean that you put a lid on the world. There is no time for that. Innovator!\r\n\r\nWe can relate work and learning to the fear of everyday insecurity. In learning played out as being force to accept predefined goals. Learning goals based on the the insecure job-market. We need to accept something more undefined . We need to convert that insecurity to a force of our own, by building internal control and sensibility instead of accepting externally forced insecurity. \r\n\r\n5 / 10 PP aka ... / HACKING -> RESEARCHING SPACE\r\n\r\nAs a concrete way we should use hacking as a research method. the English word \u201cpirate\u201d comes via Latin from Greek and means \u201cone who attempts\u201d. How can we encourage this attitude in term of education and production of knowledge? According to anarchist pedagogues, knowledge production is achieved by doing and that can be a way to dismantle the dichotomy between intellectual workers and craftmen/women (colonial, postcolonial contexts), and understand the process of knowledge as something that must oscillate between different kind of modes and speeds. As process where we need to get back to the problem at hand after being away, find different attack vectors to the same problem and so on. What will be produced is a tool box what is at stake to be change is a key to understand the work and division of work as a domestication process that we have to take control over. Free time for the spirit of learning.  \r\n\r\nThis will lead us to ask How do one manage/organise/create and run a teaching transmission space and process if knowledges should be structured without bureaucracy and administration. Is not bureaucracy related to division of labor. We need to reorganise society so all have time to learn. That is why this reorganisation is a kind of revolution, we need to brake the property loop consumer loop that keep filling our time. \r\n\r\nWe can investigate how to get a away from image of thought, ask what does it mean to be human. \r\n\r\nLearners should never be afraid of teachers or the environment they are in, that way we should all see our self as teacher and learners to try to create a safe learning environment in that sense that we break stereotypes, seek freedom way from fear, deconstruct the persona of domination.\r\n\r\nIf it won\u2019t be about result, it will be about process and attitude, how do one deal with this paradox? I think we can solve this problem by pointing to the unfinished, that the knowledge we produce always are a tendencies rather than the full answer. Even if we find clear answers to many questions the context of these question will always demand a contextualization, that led to a position where we step out of the boundaries of that original clearcut scenario. We need to value and weight the impact of the unknown, in some endeavors this will be a clear. In this case what we need to look out for where the results become a burden over processes, via power relation between student and teacher, learners and institutions. As hacker ethic say: Information and anything that can teach you something about the way the world works should be open and free. I think our mission should be to open, make and hack the systems. The systems is already out there filled with rules, laws and structures of power. It should be our concern to bend and break the rules of the everyday. Rearrange these systems and make them hackable or build new ones. A constant iteration. So in a room that accept all this, is that what we need to create?\r\n\r\n[ Long Cat] all\r\n\r\n6 / 10 aka ... /  SUBVERSION -> PERVERSION > ITERATION\r\n\r\nWe should accept that there already is a learning environment out there, with internet as a backbone. If you are a pirate, you are educated because you have tried things, hacked things. You have learned alone and with others who also are learners. If you are a pirate you constantly need access to things in order to share them. If you are a pirate that also means you are an a kind of anarchist in hart, not supportive of property, a property that implies abstract laws and regulation of your learning process. \r\n\r\nDo you have to know or master the law to subvert it or do you learn the law be subverting it? \r\n\r\nOne way to fight hegemony that digital networks good at is by subversion. It is an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power, authority, and hierarchy by iterating them. A kind of appropriation to change elements so that they are alike but still not the same, building and break chains of association. This reinterpretation is to produce a kind of long techno-lore, a folklore of technical networks. Welcome to the carnival of constant teaching, the lulz, a merge of homo faber and homo ludens, the ongoing practical imagination. \r\n\r\n[ Fotball  ] 0 - 1:00, take down sound\r\n\r\nWe need to accept a kind of perversion, a waste, we need to involve a constant discussion because there can be no knowledge without waste. There should be making space to turn around and redo, make mistakes. This space means that there is waste, a waste that the community need to bear together. We are forming a community a believers where this waste need to be shared. Teaching piratically you will always act over an insecure plane that implies sharing and bending of meaning. You might act with irony and humor and that is dangerous and powerful, a kind of drain and so on. A ritual of kopimi means are constantly in search for the meaning of things by remaking them, to learn repeating. To learn to share is about having ritual, about what happens during these repetitions. The space and time to sharing is a kind of ritual around the power of kopimi. \r\n\r\n[slide repetition] \r\n\r\n7 / 10 aka ... / REPETITION, KOPIMI. \r\n\r\nTo learn a language, a dance, to love is about repeating, there can be no knowledge without repetition. Meeting, encounters and repeating them. \r\n\r\nThere is an unbelievable absurdity of stopping our basic urge of repetition, copying, mimicry, memesis and difference. So when we are denied the pure force kopimi, learning and difference are denied us. This mean breaking the chain of knowledge, the possibility to translate and retranslate, to stand on the shoulders of giants and immersing in the networks with full potential to emerging new logic, a new sensibility, new capacities, networks and futures. To stop the obsolete regulatory centralizing flow, that is why some of us must fight intellectual property and other finds way to circumvent and reroute.   \r\n \r\nBefore digital technology to repeat, to copy, meant creating a generation, a similarity, a nonconvergent act where law and things were separated. With the invention of the universal machine, the computer, with digital repetition, digital copying, things and laws are converting into the same space of control, code becomes the law, the act of coping are converted into a digital performative environment of the act itself. The code is performativ, becomes a life space. \r\n\r\nThe capacity of social actors to resist and challenge power and institutional power, create alternative forms of living that reduce the power of the irregular capitalist institutions. Reappropriate personal capacity to create knowledge as a commons. A question of stopping or make way for reperformativity.  \r\n\r\n[ play video of enlightenment ]\r\n\r\n8 / 10 aka ... / ENLIGHTENMENT\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, learning meant spending time in the master workshop learning techne. Transmission of knowledge went through personal and intimate situations, the transept of know-how was precise, local and site specific. The secrets of the master was transmitted with practise. \r\n\r\nWith book printing and specifically the encyclopedia, the recipe of know-how becomes to a larger degree public, published and in reach for those that could buy the books. Secrets of know-how keep by the guilds suddenly becomes available on the market and more public. \r\n\r\nRegulating processes are formed around book publishing also becomes a way the control a possible freedom and self-organisation where access to knowledge one key. Even if the means of production were not in the hands of ordinary people the enclosing of knowledge put an extra layer of control way from actualization. \r\n\r\nThe recuperation of the know-how in the master workshop as local labor, based on local relations and agreements are gradually shifting and expanding to central control over a communications schema distance of speeds, laws, regulation and routes of modern management. The light of the enlightenment are brought forward but are stilled hold back. In this way the enlightenment can still be considered a unfinished project. And more over with a  shadow project of a real darkness discussed as vanilla the modern systems management.\r\n\r\nTo quote the purpose of whole earth catalog from 1969\r\nPurpose\r\nWe are as gods and might as well get good at it.

How transparency openness modulate the relation between private and public.\r\n\r\nNowaday google, youtube and the pirate bay can be considered the new Encyclopedia, key words means more than alphabetical order.
